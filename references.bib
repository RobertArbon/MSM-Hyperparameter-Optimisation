	title = {An Efficient Approach for Assessing Hyperparameter Importance},
	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/hutter14.html},
	abstract = {The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional {ANOVA} framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that—even in very high-dimensional cases—most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

	abstract = {We propose Algorithm Distillation ({AD}), a method for distilling reinforcement learning ({RL}) algorithms into neural networks by modeling their training histories with a causal sequence model. Algorithm Distillation treats learning to reinforcement learn as an across-episode sequential prediction problem. A dataset of learning histories is generated by a source {RL} algorithm, and then a causal transformer is trained by autoregressively predicting actions given their preceding learning histories as context. Unlike sequential policy prediction architectures that distill post-learning or expert sequences, {AD} is able to improve its policy entirely in-context without updating its network parameters. We demonstrate that {AD} can reinforcement learn in-context in a variety of environments with sparse rewards, combinatorial task structure, and pixel-based observations, and find that {AD} learns a more data-efficient {RL} algorithm than the one that generated the source data.},

These lecture notes exploit the strong connections between deep learning algorithms and the more conventional techniques of computational physics to achieve two goals. First, they use concepts from computational physics to develop an understanding of deep learning algorithms. Not surprisingly, many concepts in deep learning can be connected to similar concepts in computational physics, and one can utilize this connection to better understand these algorithms. Second, several novel deep learning algorithms can be used to solve challenging problems in computational physics.

That social interaction matters is recognized by any experimentalist who seeks to exclude its influence by studying individuals in isolation. On this view, interaction complicates cognition. Here, we explore the more radical stance that interaction co-constitutes cognition: that we benefit from looking beyond single minds toward cognition as a process involving interacting minds. All around the cognitive sciences, there are approaches that put interaction center stage. Their diverse and pluralistic origins may obscure the fact that collectively, they harbor insights and methods that can respecify foundational assumptions and fuel novel interdisciplinary work. What might the cognitive sciences gain from stronger interactional foundations? This represents, we believe, one of the key questions for the future. Writing as a transdisciplinary collective assembled from across the classic cognitive science hexagon and beyond, we highlight the opportunity for a figure-ground reversal that puts interaction at the heart of cognition. The interactive stance is a way of seeing that deserves to be a key part of the conceptual toolkit of cognitive scientists.},

	abstract = {Simulations of molecular systems using electronic structure methods are still not feasible for many systems of biological importance. As a result, empirical methods such as force fields ({FF}) have become an established tool for the simulation of large and complex molecular systems. The parametrization of {FF} is, however, time-consuming and has traditionally been based on experimental data. Recent years have therefore seen increasing efforts to automatize {FF} parametrization or to replace {FF} with machine-learning ({ML}) based potentials. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to parametrize {FF}, which makes use of {ML} and gradient-descent based optimization while retaining a functional form founded in physics. Using a predefined functional form is shown to enable interpretability, robustness, and efficient simulations of large systems over long time scales. To demonstrate the strength of the proposed method, a fixed-charge and a polarizable model are trained on ab initio potential-energy surfaces. Given only information about the constituting elements, the molecular topology, and reference potential energies, the models successfully learn to assign atom types and corresponding {FF} parameters from scratch. The resulting models and parameters are validated on a wide range of experimentally and computationally derived properties of systems including dimers, pure liquids, and molecular crystals.},

We use Tracr to create a range of ground truth transformers that implement programs including computing token frequencies, sorting, and Dyck-n parenthesis checking, among others. To enable the broader research community to explore and use compiled models, we provide an open-source implementation of Tracr at https://github.com/deepmind/tracr.},

They encode prior information about the modeled function and can be used for exact or approximate Bayesian learning. In many applications, particularly in physical sciences and engineering, but also in areas such as geostatistics and neuroscience, invariance to symmetries is one of the most fundamental forms of prior information one can consider. The invariance of a Gaussian process' covariance to such symmetries gives rise to the most natural generalization of the concept of stationarity to such spaces. In this work, we develop constructive and practical techniques for building stationary Gaussian processes on a very large class of non-Euclidean spaces arising in the context of symmetries. Our techniques make it possible to (i) calculate covariance kernels and (ii) sample from prior and posterior Gaussian processes defined on such spaces, both in a practical manner. This work is split into two parts, each involving different technical considerations: part I studies compact spaces, while part {II} studies non-compact spaces possessing certain structure. Our contributions make the non-Euclidean Gaussian process models we study compatible with well-understood computational techniques available in standard Gaussian process software packages, thereby making them accessible to practitioners.},

As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces. It takes as input a concatenation of weights and biases of a pre-trained {MLP} and processes it using a composition of layers that are equivariant to the natural permutation symmetry of the {MLP}'s weights: Changing the order of neurons in intermediate layers of the {MLP} does not affect the function it represents. We provide a full characterization of all affine equivariant and invariant layers for these symmetries and show how these layers can be implemented using three basic operations: pooling, broadcasting, and fully connected layers applied to the input in an appropriate manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture and its advantages over natural baselines in a variety of learning tasks.},

	abstract = {Researchers faced with incomplete data are encouraged to consider whether their data are ‘missing completely at random’ ({MCAR}), ‘missing at random’ ({MAR}) or ‘missing not at random’ ({MNAR}) when planning their analysis. However, there are two major problems with this classification as originally defined by Rubin in the 1970s. First, when there are missing data in multiple variables, the plausibility of the {MAR} assumption is difficult to assess using substantive knowledge and is more stringent than is generally appreciated. Second, although {MCAR} and {MAR} are sufficient conditions for consistent estimation with specific methods, they are not necessary conditions and therefore this categorization does not directly determine the best approach for handling the missing data in an analysis. How best to handle missing data depends on the assumed causal relationships between variables and their missingness, and what these relationships imply in terms of the ‘recoverability’ of the target estimand (the population parameter that encodes the answer to the underlying research question). Recoverability is defined as whether the estimand can be consistently estimated from the patterns and associations in the observed data without needing to invoke external information on the extent to which the distribution of missing values might differ from that of observed values. In this manuscript we outline an approach for deciding which method to use to handle multivariable missing data in an analysis, using directed acyclic graphs to depict missingness assumptions and determining the implications in terms of recoverability of the target estimand.},

We suggest that the more relevant and interesting question is how difficult it is to cluster data sets \{{\textbackslash}em that can be clustered well\}. More generally, despite the ubiquity and the great importance of clustering, we still do not have a satisfactory mathematical theory of clustering. In order to properly understand clustering, it is clearly necessary to develop a solid theoretical basis for the area. For example, from the perspective of computational complexity theory the clustering problem seems very hard. Numerous papers introduce various criteria and numerical measures to quantify the quality of a given clustering. The resulting conclusions are pessimistic, since it is computationally difficult to find an optimal clustering of a given data set, if we go by any of these popular criteria. In contrast, the practitioners' perspective is much more optimistic. Our explanation for this disparity of opinions is that complexity theory concentrates on the worst case, whereas in reality we only care for data sets that can be clustered well. We introduce a theoretical framework of clustering in metric spaces that revolves around a notion of "good clustering". We show that if a good clustering exists, then in many cases it can be efficiently found. Our conclusion is that contrary to popular belief, clustering should not be considered a hard task.},

However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on {SE}(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of {SE}(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, {FrameDiff}, for learning the {SE}(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply {FrameDiff} on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods.

Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching ({FM}), a simulation-free approach for training {CNFs} based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples -- which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing {FM} with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training {CNFs} with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport ({OT}) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training {CNFs} using Flow Matching on {ImageNet} leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical {ODE} solvers.},

The key ingredient behind {RFM} is the construction of a simple kernel function for defining per-sample vector fields, which subsumes existing Euclidean cases. Extending to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute kernel functions.

	abstract = {Determining the three-dimensional structure of proteins in their native functional states has been a longstanding challenge in structural biology. While integrative structural biology has been the most effective way to get a high-accuracy structure of different conformations and mechanistic insights for larger proteins, advances in deep machine-learning algorithms have paved the way to fully computational predictions. In this field, {AlphaFold}2 ({AF}2) pioneered ab initio high-accuracy single-chain modeling. Since then, different customizations have expanded the number of conformational states accessible through {AF}2. Here, we further expanded {AF}2 with the aim of enriching an ensemble of models with user-defined functional or structural features. We tackled two common protein families for drug discovery, G-protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) and kinases. Our approach automatically identifies the best templates satisfying the specified features and combines those with genetic information. We also introduced the possibility of shuffling the selected templates to expand the space of solutions. In our benchmark, models showed the intended bias and great accuracy. Our protocol can thus be exploited for modeling user-defined conformational states in an automatic fashion.},

This scheme substantially enhances the efficiency of the transition path sampling simulations, particularly for systems with multiple transition channels, and yields information on thermodynamics, kinetics and reaction coordinates of molecular processes without distorting their dynamics. The method is illustrated using the isomerization of proline in the {KPTP} tetrapeptide.},

	abstract = {We present a new method to compute free energies at a quantum mechanical ({QM}) level of theory from molecular simulations using cheap reference potential energy functions, such as force fields. To overcome the poor overlap between the reference and target distributions, we generalize targeted free energy perturbation ({TFEP}) to employ multiple configuration maps. While {TFEP} maps have been obtained before from an expensive training of a normalizing flow neural network ({NN}), our multimap estimator allows us to use the same set of {QM} calculations to both optimize the maps and estimate the free energy, thus removing almost completely the overhead due to training. A multimap extension of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator is also derived for cases where samples from two or more states are available. Furthermore, we propose a one-epoch learning policy that can be used to efficiently avoid overfitting when computing the loss function is expensive compared to generating data. Finally, we show how our multimap approach can be combined with enhanced sampling strategies to overcome the pervasive problem of poor convergence due to slow degrees of freedom. We test our method on the {HiPen} dataset of drug-like molecules and fragments, and we show that it can accelerate the calculation of the free energy difference of switching from a force field to a {DFTB}3 potential by about 3 orders of magnitude compared to standard {FEP} and by a factor of about 8 compared to previously published nonequilibrium calculations.},

Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Generative models are classes of models that can generate observations randomly concerning certain implied parameters. Recently, the diffusion Model has become a rising class of generative models by its power-generating ability. Nowadays, great achievements have been reached. More applications except for computer vision, speech generation, bioinformatics, and natural language processing are to be explored in this field. However, the diffusion model has its genuine drawback of a slow generation process, single data types, low likelihood, and the inability for dimension reduction. They are leading to many enhanced works. This survey makes a summary of the field of the diffusion model. We first state the main problem with two landmark works -- {DDPM} and {DSM}, and a unified landmark work -- Score {SDE}. Then, we present improved techniques for existing problems in the diffusion-based model field, including speed-up improvement For model speed-up improvement, data structure diversification, likelihood optimization, and dimension reduction. Regarding existing models, we also provide a benchmark of {FID} score, {IS}, and {NLL} according to specific {NFE}.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation is a widely used technique to simulate molecular systems, most commonly at the all-atom resolution where the equations of motion are integrated with timesteps on the order of femtoseconds (\$1{\textbackslash}textrm\{fs\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}{\textbackslash}textrm\{s\}\$). {MD} is often used to compute equilibrium properties, which requires sampling from an equilibrium distribution such as the Boltzmann distribution. However, many important processes, such as binding and folding, occur over timescales of milliseconds or beyond, and cannot be efficiently sampled with conventional {MD}. Furthermore, new {MD} simulations need to be performed from scratch for each molecular system studied. We present Timewarp, an enhanced sampling method which uses a normalising flow as a proposal distribution in a Markov chain Monte Carlo method targeting the Boltzmann distribution. The flow is trained offline on {MD} trajectories and learns to make large steps in time, simulating the molecular dynamics of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textbackslash}:{\textbackslash}textrm\{fs\}\$. Crucially, Timewarp is transferable between molecular systems: once trained, we show that it generalises to unseen small peptides (2-4 amino acids), exploring their metastable states and providing wall-clock acceleration when sampling compared to standard {MD}. Our method constitutes an important step towards developing general, transferable algorithms for accelerating {MD}.},

	abstract = {Many processes in chemistry and biology involve interactions of a ligand with its molecular target. Interest in the mechanism governing such interactions has dominated theoretical and experimental analysis for over a century. The interpretation of molecular recognition has evolved from a simple rigid body association of the ligand with its target to appreciation of the key role played by conformational transitions. Two conceptually distinct descriptions have had a profound impact on our understanding of mechanisms of ligand binding. The first description, referred to as induced fit, assumes that conformational changes follow the initial binding step to optimize the complex between the ligand and its target. The second description, referred to as conformational selection, assumes that the free target exists in multiple conformations in equilibrium and that the ligand selects the optimal one for binding. Both descriptions can be merged into more complex reaction schemes that better describe the functional repertoire of macromolecular systems. This review deals with basic mechanisms of ligand binding, with special emphasis on induced fit, conformational selection, and their mathematical foundations to provide rigorous context for the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. We show that conformational selection is a surprisingly versatile mechanism that includes induced fit as a mathematical special case and even captures kinetic properties of more complex reaction schemes. These features make conformational selection a dominant mechanism of molecular recognition in biology, consistent with the rich conformational landscape accessible to biological macromolecules being unraveled by structural biology.},

Many such methods rely on the identification of an appropriate set of collective variables. These are meant to describe the system’s modes that most slowly approach equilibrium under the action of the sampling algorithm. Once identified, the equilibration of these modes is accelerated by the enhanced sampling method of choice. An attractive way of determining the collective variables is to relate them to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the transfer operator. Unfortunately, this requires knowing the long-term dynamics of the system beforehand, which is generally not available. However, we have recently shown that it is indeed possible to determine efficient collective variables starting from biased simulations. In this paper, we bring the power of machine learning and the efficiency of the recently developed on the fly probability-enhanced sampling method to bear on this approach. The result is a powerful and robust algorithm that, given an initial enhanced sampling simulation performed with trial collective variables or generalized ensembles, extracts transfer operator eigenfunctions using a neural network ansatz and then accelerates them to promote sampling of rare events. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we apply it to several systems, ranging from the conformational transition of a small molecule to the folding of a miniprotein and the study of materials crystallization.},

First, we discretize the conformational space in a Voronoi tessellation, then the transition rates between adjacent cells is approximated by the geometric average of the Boltzmann weights of the Voronoi cells. This method demonstrates that there is a direct relation between the potential energy surface of molecular structures and the transition rates of conformational changes. We will show also that this approximation is correct and converges to the generator of the Smoluchowski equation in the limit of infinitely small Voronoi cells.

	abstract = {Generating a Boltzmann distribution in high dimension has recently been achieved with Normalizing Flows, which enable fast and exact computation of the generated density, and thus unbiased estimation of expectations. However, current implementations rely on accurate training data, which typically comes from computationally expensive simulations. There is therefore a clear incentive to train models with incomplete or no data by relying solely on the target density, which can be obtained from a physical energy model (up to a constant factor). For that purpose, we analyze the properties of standard losses based on Kullback-Leibler divergences. We showcase their limitations, in particular a strong propensity for mode collapse during optimization on high-dimensional distributions. We then propose strategies to alleviate these issues, most importantly a new loss function well-grounded in theory and with suitable optimization properties. Using as a benchmark the generation of 3D molecular configurations, we show on several tasks that, for the first time, imperfect pre-trained models can be further optimized in the absence of training data.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Rapid computational exploration of the free energy landscape of biological molecules remains an active area of research due to the difficulty of sampling rare state transitions in Molecular Dynamics ({MD}) simulations. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have exploited Machine Learning ({ML}) models to enhance and analyze {MD} simulations. Notably, unsupervised models that extract kinetic information from a set of parallel trajectories have been proposed, including the variational approach for Markov processes ({VAMP}), {VAMPNets}, and time-lagged variational autoencoders ({TVAE}). In this work, we propose a combination of adaptive sampling with active learning of kinetic models to accelerate the discovery of the conformational landscape of biomolecules. In particular, we introduce and compare several techniques that combine kinetic models with two adaptive sampling regimes (least counts and multi-agent reinforcement learning-based adaptive sampling) to enhance the exploration of conformational ensembles without introducing biasing forces. Moreover, inspired by the active learning approach of uncertainty-based sampling, we also present {MaxEnt} {VAMPNet}. This technique consists of restarting simulations from the microstates that maximize the Shannon entropy of a {VAMPNet} trained to perform soft discretization of metastable states. By running simulations on two test systems, the {WLALL} pentapeptide and the villin headpiece subdomain, we empirically demonstrate that {MaxEnt} {VAMPNet} results in faster exploration of conformational landscapes compared to the baseline and other proposed methods.},

In this work we train models up to 15 billion parameters, the largest language models of proteins to be evaluated to date. We find that as models are scaled they learn information enabling the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. We present {ESMFold} for high accuracy end-to-end atomic level structure prediction directly from the individual sequence of a protein. {ESMFold} has similar accuracy to {AlphaFold}2 and {RoseTTAFold} for sequences with low perplexity that are well understood by the language model. {ESMFold} inference is an order of magnitude faster than {AlphaFold}2, enabling exploration of the structural space of metagenomic proteins in practical timescales.},

            Proteins exist in several different conformations. These structural changes are often associated with fluctuations at the residue level. Recent findings show that co-evolutionary analysis coupled with machine-learning techniques improves the precision by providing quantitative distance predictions between pairs of residues. The predicted statistical distance distribution from Multi Sequence Analysis reveals the presence of different local maxima suggesting the flexibility of key residue pairs. Here we investigate the ability of the residue-residue distance prediction to provide insights into the protein conformational ensemble. We combine deep learning approaches with mechanistic modeling to a set of proteins that experimentally showed conformational changes. The predicted protein models were filtered based on energy scores, {RMSD} clustering, and the centroids selected as the lowest energy structure per cluster. These models were compared to the experimental-Molecular Dynamics ({MD}) relaxed structure by analyzing the backbone residue torsional distribution and the sidechain orientations. Our pipeline allows to retrieve the experimental structural dynamics experimentally represented by different X-ray conformations for the same sequence as well the conformational space observed with the {MD} simulations. We show the potential correlation between the experimental structure dynamics and the predicted model ensemble demonstrating the susceptibility of the current state-of-the-art methods in protein folding and dynamics prediction and pointing out the areas of improvement.},

The trajectory picture provides a straightforward basis for understanding first-passage times, “mechanisms” in complex systems, and fundamental constraints on the apparent reversibility of complex processes. Trajectories make concrete the physics underlying the diffusion and Fokker–Planck partial differential equations.

The mean square displacement ({MSD}) of the tracers reveals a transition to subdiffusive motion {MSD} ∼ tα as soon as the accessible volume fraction p in the gel decreases from unity. Individual tracer dynamics reveals two types of particles in the gels: mobile tracers cross the system through percolating pores following subdiffusive dynamics {MSDmob} ∼ tαmob, while a fraction ptrap(p) of the particles remain trapped in finite pores. Below the void percolation threshold p {\textless} pc all the particles get trapped and α → 0. By separately studying both populations we find a simple phenomenological law for the mobile tracers αmob(p) ≈ a ln p + c where c ≈ 1 and a ∼ 0.2 depends on the gel type. On the other hand, a cluster-analysis of the gel accessible volume reveals a power law for the trapping probability ptrap ∼ (p/pc)−γ, with γ ≃ 2.9. This yields a prediction for the ensemble averaged subdiffusion exponent α = αmob(1 − ptrap). Our predictions are successfully validated against the different gels studied here and against numerical and experimental results in the literature (silica gels, polyacrylamide gels, flexible F-actin networks and in different random obstacles). Notably, the parameter a ∼ 0.2 presents small differences amongst all these cases, indicating the robustness of the proposed relation.},

	abstract = {Calculating interactions or correlations between pairs of particles is typically the most time-consuming task in particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on modern {CPU} and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data ({SIMD}) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain cut-off distance, good {SIMD} utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present an algorithm for {SIMD} parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more efficient {SIMD} parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to {SIMD} units of various widths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on current {CPUs} and accelerator architectures like {GPUs} or Intel {MIC}, but it also makes the algorithm future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of the effective buffering the method introduces.},

	abstract = {Recently, a novel concept for the computation ofessentialfeatures of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems (such as molecular dynamics) has been proposed. The realization of this concept had been based on subdivision techniques applied to the Frobenius–Perron operator for the dynamical system. The present paper suggests an alternative but related concept that merges the conceptual advantages of the dynamical systems approach with the appropriate statistical physics framework. This approach allows us to define the phrase “conformation” in terms of the dynamical behavior of the molecular system and to characterize the dynamical stability of conformations. In a first step, the frequency of conformational changes is characterized in statistical terms leading to the definition of some Markov {operatorTthat} describes the corresponding transition probabilities within the canonical ensemble. In a second step, a discretization {ofTvia} specific hybrid Monte Carlo techniques is shown to lead to {astochasticmatrixP}. With these theoretical preparaions, an identification algorithm for conformations (to be presented in a later paper) is applicable. It is demonstrated that the discretization {ofTcan} be restricted to few essential degrees of freedom so that the combinatorial explosion of discretization boxes is prevented and biomolecular systems can be attacked. Numerical results for the n-pentane molecule and the triribonucleotide adenylyl(3′–5′)cytidylyl(3′–5′)cytidin are given and interpreted.},

Controversy may ensue when such tools are introduced to fields traditionally reliant on individual clinical evaluations. Such controversy has arisen about “actuarial” assessments of violence recidivism risk, that is, the probability that someone found to have committed a violent act will commit another during a specified period. Recently, Hart, Michie, and Cooke (2007a) and subsequent papers from these authors in several reputable journals have claimed to demonstrate that statistical assessments of such risks are inherently too imprecise to be useful, using arguments that would seem to apply to statistical risk prediction quite broadly. This commentary examines these arguments from a technical statistical perspective, and finds them seriously mistaken in many particulars. They should play no role in reasoned discussions of violence recidivism risk assessment.},

	abstract = {The metastatic invasion of basement membrane by tumor cells involves the binding of tumor cells to laminin. Laminin, a glycoprotein, is a major component of basement membrane. Both tumor and normal cells express a high-affinity receptor for laminin; however, the expression is more pronounced with tumor cells. The pentapeptide, Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg, ({YIGSR}), an amino acid sequence from the B1 chain of laminin, was found to compete with laminin for binding to the laminin receptor. The binding of tumor cells to laminin can be inhibited competitively by {YIGSR} and, in mice, this has been shown to be translated into a reduction in metastasis. Reports of structural modifications of {YIGSR} leading to molecules with enhanced activity led us to attempt to learn more about the secondary structure of {YIGSR}. Through the use of {CHARMM}, a molecular mechanics program, we were able to discover a conformation of N-acetyl-{YIGSR}-{NHCH}3 that is stable over a wide range of dielectric constants. In this conformation the arginine side chain acts to hold Tyr, Ile, and Gly in a partial right-handed alpha helix. We speculate that this partial alpha helical structure is necessary for binding to the lamin receptor and thereby its antimetastatic activity.},

The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the {GROMOS} force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the {GROMOS} force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the {GROMOS} force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 25: 1656–1676, 2004},

We review the principles of {XAI} in the domain of chemistry and emerging methods for creating and evaluating explanations.

We show that {XAI} methods like chemical counterfactuals and descriptor explanations can both explain {DL} predictions and give insight into structure-property relationships. Finally, we discuss how a two step process of highly accurate black-box modeling and then creating explanations gives both highly accurate predictions and clear structure-property relationships.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of Sampling Transition Paths. Given two metastable conformational states of a molecular system, eg. a folded and unfolded protein, we aim to sample the most likely transition path between the two states. Sampling such a transition path is computationally expensive due to the existence of high free energy barriers between the two states. To circumvent this, previous work has focused on simplifying the trajectories to occur along specific molecular descriptors called Collective Variables ({CVs}). However, finding {CVs} is not trivial and requires chemical intuition. For larger molecules, where intuition is not sufficient, using these {CV}-based methods biases the transition along possibly irrelevant dimensions. Instead, this work proposes a method for sampling transition paths that consider the entire geometry of the molecules. To achieve this, we first relate the problem to recent work on the Schrodinger bridge problem and stochastic optimal control. Using this relation, we construct a method that takes into account important characteristics of molecular systems such as second-order dynamics and invariance to rotations and translations. We demonstrate our method on the commonly studied Alanine Dipeptide, but also consider larger proteins such as Polyproline and Chignolin.},

Through the definition of steerable node attributes, the {MLPs} provide a new class of activation functions for general use with steerable feature fields. We discuss ours and related work through the lens of equivariant non-linear convolutions, which further allows us to pin-point the successful components of {SEGNNs}: non-linear message aggregation improves upon classic linear (steerable) point convolutions; steerable messages improve upon recent equivariant graph networks that send invariant messages.

However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.},

This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labeled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text. This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated "all-purpose" inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation is widely used to study protein conformations and dynamics. However, conventional simulation suffers from being trapped in some local energy minima that are hard to escape. Thus, most of the computational time is spent sampling in the already visited regions. This leads to an inefficient sampling process and further hinders the exploration of protein movements in affordable simulation time. The advancement of deep learning provides new opportunities for protein sampling. Variational autoencoders are a class of deep learning models to learn a low-dimensional representation (referred to as the latent space) that can capture the key features of the input data. Based on this characteristic, we proposed a new adaptive sampling method, latent space-assisted adaptive sampling for protein trajectories ({LAST}), to accelerate the exploration of protein conformational space. This method comprises cycles of (i) variational autoencoder training, (ii) seed structure selection on the latent space, and (iii) conformational sampling through additional {MD} simulations. The proposed approach is validated through the sampling of four structures of two protein systems: two metastable states of Escherichia coli adenosine kinase ({ADK}) and two native states of Vivid ({VVD}). In all four conformations, seed structures were shown to lie on the boundary of conformation distributions. Moreover, large conformational changes were observed in a shorter simulation time when compared with structural dissimilarity sampling ({SDS}) and conventional {MD} ({cMD}) simulations in both systems. In metastable {ADK} simulations, {LAST} explored two transition paths toward two stable states, while {SDS} explored only one and {cMD} neither. In {VVD} light state simulations, {LAST} was three times faster than {cMD} simulation with a similar conformational space. Overall, {LAST} is comparable to {SDS} and is a promising tool in adaptive sampling. The {LAST} method is publicly available at https://github.com/smu-tao-group/{LAST} to facilitate related research.},

	abstract = {Proteins are macromolecules that perform essential functions in all living organisms. Designing novel proteins with specific structures and desired functions has been a long-standing challenge in the field of bioengineering. Existing approaches generate both protein sequence and structure using either autoregressive models or diffusion models, both of which suffer from high inference costs. In this paper, we propose a new approach capable of protein sequence and structure co-design, which iteratively translates both protein sequence and structure into the desired state from random initialization, based on context features given a priori. Our model consists of a trigonometry-aware encoder that reasons geometrical constraints and interactions from context features, and a roto-translation equivariant decoder that translates protein sequence and structure interdependently. Notably, all protein amino acids are updated in one shot in each translation step, which significantly accelerates the inference process. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin, and is able to design proteins of high fidelity as regards both sequence and structure, with running time orders of magnitude less than sampling-based methods.},

	abstract = {Learning the design patterns of proteins from sequences across evolution may have promise toward generative protein design. However it is unknown whether language models, trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins to generate de novo proteins. We focus on two protein design tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified, and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or 67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6 designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone design, the language model generates successful designs for each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129 or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar structural contexts in known protein families. The results show that language models, though only trained on sequences, learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

Diffusion models10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modeling but limited success when applied to protein modeling, likely due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show that by fine tuning the {RoseTTAFold} structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding, and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called {RoseTTAFold} Diffusion ({RFdiffusion}), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of new designs.

To perform {NAS}, we randomly sample architectures and use the validation accuracy of networks with {GHN} generated weights as the surrogate search signal. {GHNs} are fast -- they can search nearly 10 times faster than other random search methods on {CIFAR}-10 and {ImageNet}. {GHNs} can be further extended to the anytime prediction setting, where they have found networks with better speed-accuracy tradeoff than the state-of-the-art manual designs.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2112.13487},
	abstract = {A fundamental challenge in interactive learning and decision making, ranging from bandit problems to reinforcement learning, is to provide sample-efficient, adaptive learning algorithms that achieve near-optimal regret. This question is analogous to the classical problem of optimal (supervised) statistical learning, where there are well-known complexity measures (e.g., {VC} dimension and Rademacher complexity) that govern the statistical complexity of learning. However, characterizing the statistical complexity of interactive learning is substantially more challenging due to the adaptive nature of the problem. The main result of this work provides a complexity measure, the Decision-Estimation Coefficient, that is proven to be both necessary and sufficient for sample-efficient interactive learning. In particular, we provide: 1. a lower bound on the optimal regret for any interactive decision making problem, establishing the Decision-Estimation Coefficient as a fundamental limit. 2. a unified algorithm design principle, Estimation-to-Decisions (E2D), which transforms any algorithm for supervised estimation into an online algorithm for decision making. E2D attains a regret bound matching our lower bound, thereby achieving optimal sample-efficient learning as characterized by the Decision-Estimation Coefficient. Taken together, these results constitute a theory of learnability for interactive decision making. When applied to reinforcement learning settings, the Decision-Estimation Coefficient recovers essentially all existing hardness results and lower bounds. More broadly, the approach can be viewed as a decision-theoretic analogue of the classical Le Cam theory of statistical estimation; it also unifies a number of existing approaches -- both Bayesian and frequentist.},

Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed.

As a result, deep networks are often seen as black boxes with unclear interpretations and reliability. Understanding the performance of deep neural networks is one of the greatest scientific challenges. This work aims to apply principles and techniques from information theory to deep learning models to increase our theoretical understanding and design better algorithms. We first describe our information-theoretic approach to deep learning. Then, we propose using the Information Bottleneck ({IB}) theory to explain deep learning systems. The novel paradigm for analyzing networks sheds light on their layered structure, generalization abilities, and learning dynamics. We later discuss one of the most challenging problems of applying the {IB} to deep neural networks - estimating mutual information. Recent theoretical developments, such as the neural tangent kernel ({NTK}) framework, are used to investigate generalization signals. In our study, we obtained tractable computations of many information-theoretic quantities and their bounds for infinite ensembles of infinitely wide neural networks. With these derivations, we can determine how compression, generalization, and sample size pertain to the network and how they are related. At the end, we present the dual Information Bottleneck ({dualIB}). This new information-theoretic framework resolves some of the {IB}'s shortcomings by merely switching terms in the distortion function. The {dualIB} can account for known data features and use them to make better predictions over unseen examples. An analytical framework reveals the underlying structure and optimal representations, and a variational framework using deep neural network optimization validates the results.},

Synthesis and experimental measurements of kinetic rate constants are, however, expensive and time consuming. In this work, we aimed to obtain drug residence times computationally. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm to identify molecular design objectives based on ligand unbinding kinetics. We designed an enhanced sampling technique to accurately predict the free-energy profiles of the ligand unbinding process, focusing on the free-energy barrier for unbinding. Our method first identifies unbinding paths determining a corresponding set of internal coordinates ({ICs}) that form contacts between the protein and the ligand; it then iteratively updates these interactions during a series of biased molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations to reveal the {ICs} that are important for the whole of the unbinding process. Subsequently, we performed finite-temperature string simulations to obtain the free-energy barrier for unbinding using the set of {ICs} as a complex reaction coordinate. Importantly, we also aimed to enable the further design of drugs focusing on improved residence times. To this end, we developed a supervised machine learning ({ML}) approach with inputs from unbiased “downhill” trajectories initiated near the transition state ({TS}) ensemble of the string unbinding path. We demonstrate that our {ML} method can identify key ligand–protein interactions driving the system through the {TS}. Some of the most important drugs for cancer treatment are kinase inhibitors. One of these kinase targets is cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ({CDK}2), an appealing target for anticancer drug development. Here, we tested our method using two different {CDK}2 inhibitors for the potential further development of these compounds. We compared the free-energy barriers obtained from our calculations with those observed in available experimental data. We highlighted important interactions at the distal ends of the ligands that can be targeted for improved residence times. Our method provides a new tool to determine unbinding rates and to identify key structural features of the inhibitors that can be used as starting points for novel design strategies in drug discovery.},

We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, {\textbackslash}chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as {\textbackslash}gopher but with 70B parameters and 4\${\textbackslash}times\$ more more data. {\textbackslash}chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms {\textbackslash}Gopher (280B), {GPT}-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing {NLG} (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that {\textbackslash}chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, {\textbackslash}chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5{\textbackslash}\% on the {MMLU} benchmark, greater than a 7{\textbackslash}\% improvement over {\textbackslash}gopher.},

	abstract = {Classifier guidance is a recently introduced method to trade off mode coverage and sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models post training, in the same spirit as low temperature sampling or truncation in other types of generative models. Classifier guidance combines the score estimate of a diffusion model with the gradient of an image classifier and thereby requires training an image classifier separate from the diffusion model. It also raises the question of whether guidance can be performed without a classifier. We show that guidance can be indeed performed by a pure generative model without such a classifier: in what we call classifier-free guidance, we jointly train a conditional and an unconditional diffusion model, and we combine the resulting conditional and unconditional score estimates to attain a trade-off between sample quality and diversity similar to that obtained using classifier guidance.},

A recent family of approaches for solving these problems uses stochastic algorithms that sample from the posterior distribution of natural images given the measurements.

This work addresses these issues by introducing Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models ({DDRM}), an efficient, unsupervised posterior sampling method. Motivated by variational inference, {DDRM} takes advantage of a pre-trained denoising diffusion generative model for solving any linear inverse problem. We demonstrate {DDRM}'s versatility on several image datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and colorization under various amounts of measurement noise. {DDRM} outperforms the current leading unsupervised methods on the diverse {ImageNet} dataset in reconstruction quality, perceptual quality, and runtime, being 5x faster than the nearest competitor. {DDRM} also generalizes well for natural images out of the distribution of the observed {ImageNet} training set.},

Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons.

We present a stochastic differential equation ({SDE}) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time {SDE} that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time {SDE} depends only on the time-dependent gradient field ({\textbackslash}aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical {SDE} solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time {SDE}. We also derive an equivalent neural {ODE} that samples from the same distribution as the {SDE}, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency.

Conformal prediction is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90\%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed to provide the reader a working understanding of conformal prediction and related distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques with one self-contained document. We lead the reader through practical theory for and examples of conformal prediction and describe its extensions to complex machine learning tasks involving structured outputs, distribution shift, time-series, outliers, models that abstain, and more.

We describe protein backbone structure as a series of consecutive angles capturing the relative orientation of the constituent amino acid residues, and generate new structures by denoising from a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Not only does this mirror how proteins biologically twist into energetically favorable conformations, the inherent shift and rotational invariance of this representation crucially alleviates the need for complex equivariant networks.

Through regularized prediction heads, {ReLSO} introduces a powerful protein sequence encoder and a novel approach for efficient fitness landscape traversal. Using {ReLSO}, we explicitly model the sequence–function landscape of large labelled datasets and generate new molecules by optimizing within the latent space using gradient-based methods. We evaluate this approach on several publicly available protein datasets, including variant sets of anti-ranibizumab and green fluorescent protein. We observe a greater sequence optimization efficiency (increase in fitness per optimization step) using {ReLSO} compared with other approaches, where {ReLSO} more robustly generates high-fitness sequences. Furthermore, the attention-based relationships learned by the jointly trained {ReLSO} models provide a potential avenue towards sequence-level fitness attribution information.},

	abstract = {Message-passing neural networks ({MPNNs}) are the leading architecture for deep learning on graph-structured data, in large part due to their simplicity and scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks ({ESAN}) to address this issue. Our main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an {MPNN}, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-{WL}) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of {ESAN} in terms of these new {WL} variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both {MPNNs} and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost, we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive power and overall performance of popular {GNN} architectures.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2209.15486},
	abstract = {Many Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}) perform poorly compared to simple heuristics on Link Prediction ({LP}) tasks. This is due to limitations in expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most {LP} heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for {LP}, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph {GNN} ({SGNN}) methods for link prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph {GNN} called {ELPH} (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of {SGNNs} without explicit subgraph construction. {ELPH} is provably more expressive than Message Passing {GNNs} ({MPNNs}). It outperforms existing {SGNN} models on many standard {LP} benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common {GNN} limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in {GPU} memory. Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called {BUDDY}, which uses feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing predictive performance. Our experiments show that {BUDDY} also outperforms {SGNNs} on standard {LP} benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than {ELPH}.},

We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop {DiffDock}, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space.

	abstract = {Neural networks embed the geometric structure of a data manifold lying in a high-dimensional space into latent representations. Ideally, the distribution of the data points in the latent space should depend only on the task, the data, the loss, and other architecture-specific constraints. However, factors such as the random weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or other sources of randomness in the training phase may induce incoherent latent spaces that hinder any form of reuse. Nevertheless, we empirically observe that, under the same data and modeling choices, distinct latent spaces typically differ by an unknown quasi-isometric transformation: that is, in each space, the distances between the encodings do not change. In this work, we propose to adopt pairwise similarities as an alternative data representation, that can be used to enforce the desired invariance without any additional training. We show how neural architectures can leverage these relative representations to guarantee, in practice, latent isometry invariance, effectively enabling latent space communication: from zero-shot model stitching to latent space comparison between diverse settings. We extensively validate the generalization capability of our approach on different datasets, spanning various modalities (images, text, graphs), tasks (e.g., classification, reconstruction) and architectures (e.g., {CNNs}, {GCNs}, transformers).},

	abstract = {Politics has in recent decades entered an era of intense polarization. Explanations have implicated digital media, with the so-called echo chamber remaining a dominant causal hypothesis despite growing challenge by empirical evidence. This paper suggests that this mounting evidence provides not only reason to reject the echo chamber hypothesis but also the foundation for an alternative causal mechanism. To propose such a mechanism, the paper draws on the literatures on affective polarization, digital media, and opinion dynamics. From the affective polarization literature, we follow the move from seeing polarization as diverging issue positions to rooted in sorting: an alignment of differences which is effectively dividing the electorate into two increasingly homogeneous megaparties. To explain the rise in sorting, the paper draws on opinion dynamics and digital media research to present a model which essentially turns the echo chamber on its head: it is not isolation from opposing views that drives polarization but precisely the fact that digital media bring us to interact outside our local bubble. When individuals interact locally, the outcome is a stable plural patchwork of cross-cutting conflicts. By encouraging nonlocal interaction, digital media drive an alignment of conflicts along partisan lines, thus effacing the counterbalancing effects of local heterogeneity. The result is polarization, even if individual interaction leads to convergence. The model thus suggests that digital media polarize through partisan sorting, creating a maelstrom in which more and more identities, beliefs, and cultural preferences become drawn into an all-encompassing societal division.},

	abstract = {Deep classifiers are known to rely on spurious features \${\textbackslash}unicode\{x2013\}\$ patterns which are correlated with the target on the training data but not inherently relevant to the learning problem, such as the image backgrounds when classifying the foregrounds. In this paper we evaluate the amount of information about the core (non-spurious) features that can be decoded from the representations learned by standard empirical risk minimization ({ERM}) and specialized group robustness training. Following recent work on Deep Feature Reweighting ({DFR}), we evaluate the feature representations by re-training the last layer of the model on a held-out set where the spurious correlation is broken. On multiple vision and {NLP} problems, we show that the features learned by simple {ERM} are highly competitive with the features learned by specialized group robustness methods targeted at reducing the effect of spurious correlations. Moreover, we show that the quality of learned feature representations is greatly affected by the design decisions beyond the training method, such as the model architecture and pre-training strategy. On the other hand, we find that strong regularization is not necessary for learning high quality feature representations. Finally, using insights from our analysis, we significantly improve upon the best results reported in the literature on the popular Waterbirds, {CelebA} hair color prediction and {WILDS}-{FMOW} problems, achieving 97\%, 92\% and 50\% worst-group accuracies, respectively.},

The method is of particular interest in strong gravitational time delay cosmography ({TDC}), where characterizing the "external convergence" (\${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ext\}\$) from the lens environment and line of sight is necessary for precise inference of the Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$). Starting from a large-scale simulation with a \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1\$'\$, we introduce fluctuations on galaxy-galaxy lensing scales of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1\$''\$ and extract random sightlines to train our {BGNN}. We then evaluate the model on test sets with varying degrees of overlap with the training distribution. For each test set of 1,000 sightlines, the {BGNN} infers the individual \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ posteriors, which we combine in a hierarchical Bayesian model to yield constraints on the hyperparameters governing the population. For a test field well sampled by the training set, the {BGNN} recovers the population mean of \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ precisely and without bias, resulting in a contribution to the \$H\_0\$ error budget well under 1{\textbackslash}\%. In the tails of the training set with sparse samples, the {BGNN}, which can ingest all available information about each sightline, extracts more \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ signal compared to a simplified version of the traditional method based on matching galaxy number counts, which is limited by sample variance.

In particular, relative binding free energy ({RBFE}) simulations are beneficial for lead optimization. To use {RBFE} simulations to compare prospective ligands in silico, researchers first plan the simulation experiment, represented by graphs where nodes represent ligands and graph edges represent alchemical transformations between ligands. Recent work demonstrated that optimizing the statistical architecture of these perturbation graphs improves the accuracy of the resultant changes in the free energy of ligand binding. Therefore, to improve the success rate of computational drug discovery, we present the open-source software package High Information Mapper ({HiMap}) --- a modernized take on its predecessor, Lead Optimization Mapper ({LOMAP}). {HiMap} removes heuristics decisions from design selection and instead finds statistically optimal graphs over ligands clustered with machine learning. Beyond optimal design generation, we present theoretical insights for designing alchemical perturbation maps. Some of these results include that for n number of nodes, the precision of perturbation maps is stable at n·ln(n) edges. We additionally find that optimal designs will converge more rapidly than radial and {LOMAP} designs. Moreover, we derive bounds for how clustering reduces cost for designs with a constant expected error, invariant of the size of the design.

	abstract = {Large transformer-based models are able to perform in-context few-shot learning, without being explicitly trained for it. This observation raises the question: what aspects of the training regime lead to this emergent behavior? Here, we show that this behavior is driven by the distributions of the training data itself. In-context learning emerges when the training data exhibits particular distributional properties such as burstiness (items appear in clusters rather than being uniformly distributed over time) and having large numbers of rarely occurring classes. In-context learning also emerges more strongly when item meanings or interpretations are dynamic rather than fixed. These properties are exemplified by natural language, but are also inherent to naturalistic data in a wide range of other domains. They also depart significantly from the uniform, i.i.d. training distributions typically used for standard supervised learning. In our initial experiments, we found that in-context learning traded off against more conventional weight-based learning, and models were unable to achieve both simultaneously. However, our later experiments uncovered that the two modes of learning could co-exist in a single model when it was trained on data following a skewed Zipfian distribution -- another common property of naturalistic data, including language. In further experiments, we found that naturalistic data distributions were only able to elicit in-context learning in transformers, and not in recurrent models. In sum, our findings indicate how the transformer architecture works together with particular properties of the training data to drive the intriguing emergent in-context learning behaviour of large language models, and how future work might encourage both in-context and in-weights learning in domains beyond language.},

Macromolecular X-ray diffraction is commonly interpreted with a static structure, but it can provide information on both the anharmonic and harmonic contributions to conformational heterogeneity. Here, through multiconformer modeling of time- and space-averaged electron density, we measure conformational heterogeneity of 743 stringently matched pairs of crystallographic datasets that reflect unbound/apo and ligand-bound/holo states. When comparing the conformational heterogeneity of side chains, we observe that when binding site residues become more rigid upon ligand binding, distant residues tend to become more flexible, especially in non-solvent-exposed regions. Among ligand properties, we observe increased protein flexibility as the number of hydrogen bonds decreases and relative hydrophobicity increases. Across a series of 13 inhibitor-bound structures of {CDK}2, we find that conformational heterogeneity is correlated with inhibitor features and identify how conformational changes propagate differences in conformational heterogeneity away from the binding site.

	abstract = {How to accurately predict the properties of molecules is an essential problem in {AI}-driven drug discovery, which generally requires a large amount of annotation for training deep learning models. Annotating molecules, however, is quite costly because it requires lab experiments conducted by experts. To reduce annotation cost, deep Active Learning ({AL}) methods are developed to select only the most representative and informative data for annotating. However, existing best deep {AL} methods are mostly developed for a single type of learning task (e.g., single-label classification), and hence may not perform well in molecular property prediction that involves various task types. In this paper, we propose a Task-type-generic active learning framework (termed Tyger) that is able to handle different types of learning tasks in a unified manner. The key is to learn a chemically-meaningful embedding space and perform active selection fully based on the embeddings, instead of relying on task-type-specific heuristics (e.g., class-wise prediction probability) as done in existing works. Specifically, for learning the embedding space, we instantiate a querying module that learns to translate molecule graphs into corresponding {SMILES} strings. Furthermore, to ensure that samples selected from the space are both representative and informative, we propose to shape the embedding space by two learning objectives, one based on domain knowledge and the other leveraging feedback from the task learner (i.e., model that performs the learning task at hand). We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of different task types. Experimental results show that Tyger consistently achieves high {AL} performance on molecular property prediction, outperforming baselines by a large margin. We also perform ablative experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component in Tyger.},

	abstract = {In adaptive-bias enhanced sampling methods, a bias potential is added to the system to drive transitions between metastable states. The bias potential is a function of a few collective variables and is gradually modified according to the underlying free energy surface. We show that when the collective variables are suboptimal, there is an exploration–convergence tradeoff, and one must choose between a quickly converging bias that will lead to fewer transitions or a slower to converge bias that can explore the phase space more efficiently but might require a much longer time to produce an accurate free energy estimate. The recently proposed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling ({OPES}) method focuses on fast convergence, but there are cases where fast exploration is preferred instead. For this reason, we introduce a new variant of the {OPES} method that focuses on quickly escaping metastable states at the expense of convergence speed. We illustrate the benefits of this approach in prototypical systems and show that it outperforms the popular metadynamics method.},

Using modular message passing graph neural networks describing both the ligand and the protein in their free and bound states, we unambiguously evidence that an explicit description of protein–ligand noncovalent interactions does not provide any advantage with respect to ligand or protein descriptors. Simple models, inferring binding affinities of test samples from that of the closest ligands or proteins in the training set, already exhibit good performances, suggesting that memorization largely dominates true learning in the deep neural networks. The current study suggests considering only noncovalent interactions while omitting their protein and ligand atomic environments. Removing all hidden biases probably requires much denser protein–ligand training matrices and a coordinated effort of the drug design community to solve the necessary protein–ligand structures.},

Using several classic examples from fisheries management, I demonstrate that selecting the model or models that produce the most accurate and precise forecast (measured by statistical scores) can sometimes lead to worse outcomes (measured by real-world objectives). This can create a forecast trap, in which the outcomes such as fish biomass or economic yield decline while the manager becomes increasingly convinced that these actions are consistent with the best models and data available. The forecast trap is not unique to this example, but a fundamental consequence of non-uniqueness of models. Existing practices promoting a broader set of models are the best way to avoid the trap.},

This paradigm commands us to map out all possible structures and sample transitions between them, a task that becomes impossible for large-scale systems such as biomolecular complexes. To arrive at scalable molecular models, we suggest moving away from global state descriptions to a set of coupled models that each describe the dynamics of local domains or sites of the molecular system. We describe limitations in the current state-of-the-art global-state Markovian modeling approaches and then introduce Markov Field Models as an umbrella term that includes models from various scientific communities, including Independent Markov Decomposition, Ising and Potts Models, and (Dynamic) Graphical Models, and evaluate their use for computational molecular biology.

Molecular dynamics simulation has been routinely used to understand conformational dynamics and molecular recognition in biomolecules. Statistical analysis of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data generated from molecular dynamics simulation requires identification of a few low-dimensional variables which can describe the essential dynamics of a system without significant loss of information. In physical chemistry, these low-dimensional variables are often called collective variables. Collective variables are used to generate reduced representations of free energy surfaces and calculate transition probabilities between different metastable basins. However the choice of collective variables is not trivial for complex systems. Collective variables range from geometric criteria such as distances and dihedral angles to abstract ones such as weighted linear combinations of multiple geometric variables. The advent of machine learning algorithms led to increasing use of abstract collective variables to represent biomolecular dynamics. In this review, I will highlight several nuances of commonly used collective variables ranging from geometric to abstract ones. Further, I will put forward some cases where machine learning based collective variables were used to describe simple systems which in principle could have been described by geometric ones. Finally, I will put forward my thoughts on artificial general intelligence and how it can be used to discover and predict collective variables from spatiotemporal data generated by molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {In-context learning refers to the ability of a model to condition on a prompt sequence consisting of in-context examples (input-output pairs corresponding to some task) along with a new query input, and generate the corresponding output. Crucially, in-context learning happens only at inference time without any parameter updates to the model. While large language models such as {GPT}-3 exhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what the relationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in the training data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, we consider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn a function class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from some functions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn "most" functions from this class? We show empirically that standard Transformers can be trained from scratch to perform in-context learning of linear functions -- that is, the trained model is able to learn unseen linear functions from in-context examples with performance comparable to the optimal least squares estimator. In fact, in-context learning is possible even under two forms of distribution shift: (i) between the training data of the model and inference-time prompts, and (ii) between the in-context examples and the query input during inference. We also show that we can train Transformers to in-context learn more complex function classes -- namely sparse linear functions, two-layer neural networks, and decision trees -- with performance that matches or exceeds task-specific learning algorithms.

We introduce three algorithms to permute the units of one model to bring them into alignment with units of a reference model. This transformation produces a functionally equivalent set of weights that lie in an approximately convex basin near the reference model. Experimentally, we demonstrate the single basin phenomenon across a variety of model architectures and datasets, including the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of zero-barrier linear mode connectivity between independently trained {ResNet} models on {CIFAR}-10 and {CIFAR}-100. Additionally, we identify intriguing phenomena relating model width and training time to mode connectivity across a variety of models and datasets. Finally, we discuss shortcomings of a single basin theory, including a counterexample to the linear mode connectivity hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Model specification -- what adjusting variables are analytically modeled –may influence results of observational associations. We present a standardized approach to quantify the variability of results obtained with choices of adjustments called the “vibration of effects” ({VoE}).

Study Design and Setting
We estimated the {VoE} for 417 clinical, environmental, and physiological variables in association with all-cause mortality using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We selected 13 variables as adjustment co-variates and computed 8,192 Cox models for each of 417 variables’ associations with all-cause mortality.

Results
We present the {VoE} by assessing the variance of the effect size and in the −log10(p-value) obtained by different combinations of adjustments. We present whether there are multimodality patterns in effect sizes and p-values and the trajectory of results with increasing adjustments. For 31\% of the 417 variables we observed a Janus effect, with the effect being in opposite direction in the 99th versus the 1st percentile of analyses. For example, the vitamin E variant α-tocopherol had a {VoE} that indicated higher and lower risk for mortality.

Conclusions
Estimating {VoE} offers empirical estimates of associations are under different model specifications. When {VoE} is large, claims for observational associations should be very cautious.},

	abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book:  Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials.   Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls.   Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications.

Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here.

	abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and thus reactivation of mutated p53 is a promising avenue for cancer therapy. Analysis of wildtype p53 and the Y220C cancer mutant long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models and validation by {NMR} relaxation studies has uncovered the involvement of loop L6 in the slowest motions of the protein. Due to its distant location from the {DNA}-binding surface, the conformational dynamics of this loop has so far remained largely unexplored. We observe mutation-induced stabilization of alternate L6 conformations, distinct from all experimentally-determined structures, in which the loop is both extended and located further away from the {DNA}-interacting surface. Additionally, the effect of the L6-adjacent Y220C mutation on the conformational landscape of the functionally-important loop L1 suggests an allosteric role to this dynamic loop and the inactivation mechanism of the mutation. Finally, the simulations reveal a novel Y220C cryptic pocket that can be targeted for p53 rescue efforts. Our approach exemplifies the power of the {MSM} methodology for uncovering intrinsic dynamic and kinetic differences among distinct protein ensembles, such as for the investigation of mutation effects on protein function.},

For a given functional form, the quality of the parameterization is crucial and will determine how accurately we can compute observable properties from simulations. While accurate force field parameterizations are available for biomolecules, such as proteins or {DNA}, the parameterization of new molecules, such as drug candidates, is particularly challenging as these may involve functional groups and interactions for which accurate parameters may not be available. Here, in an effort to address this problem, we present {ParaMol}, a Python package that has a special focus on the parameterization of bonded and nonbonded terms of druglike molecules by fitting to ab initio data. We demonstrate the software by deriving bonded terms’ parameters of three widely known drug molecules, viz. aspirin, caffeine, and a norfloxacin analogue, for which we show that, within the constraints of the functional form, the methodologies implemented in {ParaMol} are able to derive near-ideal parameters. Additionally, we illustrate the best practices to follow when employing specific parameterization routes. We also determine the sensitivity of different fitting data sets, such as relaxed dihedral scans and configurational ensembles, to the parameterization procedure, and discuss the features of the various weighting methods available to weight configurations. Owing to {ParaMol}’s capabilities, we propose that this software can be introduced as a routine step in the protocol normally employed to parameterize druglike molecules for {MM} simulations.},

This review aims to present the unifying principles and differences of several computational methods for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. Indeed, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a few statistical and physical principles. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using the same terminology and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many diﬀerent methods combine principles from a smaller class of enhanced sampling concepts.

Here we report significant breakdowns in the Stokes–Einstein ({SE}) equation from measurements of the diffusion of water (spanning 5 decades) and viscosity (spanning 12 decades) in saccharide aerosol droplets. Molecular dynamics simulations show water diffusion is not continuous, but proceeds by discrete hops between transient cavities that arise and dissipate as a result of dynamical fluctuations within the saccharide lattice. The ratio of transient cavity volume to solvent volume increases with size of molecules making up the lattice, increasing divergence from {SE} predictions. This improved mechanistic understanding of diffusion in viscous matrices explains, for example, why organic compounds equilibrate according to {SE} predictions and water equilibrates more rapidly in aerosols.},

            Partner recognition in protein binding is critical for all biological functions, and yet, delineating its mechanism is challenging, especially when recognition happens within microseconds. We present a theoretical and experimental framework based on straight-forward nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion measurements to investigate protein binding mechanisms on sub-millisecond timescales, which are beyond the reach of standard rapid-mixing experiments. This framework predicts that conformational selection prevails on ubiquitin’s paradigmatic interaction with an {SH}3 (Src-homology 3) domain. By contrast, the {SH}3 domain recognizes ubiquitin in a two-state binding process. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling reveal that the ubiquitin conformation selected for binding exhibits a characteristically extended C-terminus. Our framework is robust and expandable for implementation in other binding scenarios with the potential to show that conformational selection might be the design principle of the hubs in protein interaction networks.},

Markov state model ({MSM}) was built to facilitate identification of crucial intermediate states and possible transition pathway. Based on the analysis, we found that the region Y10-A21 in the middle of Aβ42 peptide plays an initial role in this transition. {MSM} model revealed that the collapse of helical structure in this region might trigger the formation of sheet structure. Moreover, we further simulated the aggregation of Aβ42 peptides with different conformations. We found that the Aβ42 peptides forming sheet structure have higher aggregation potential compared with peptides with helix structure. These results demonstrate that we can prevent the aggregation of Aβ42 peptides by stabilizing the helix structure in the region of Y10-A21.

Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations have become an indispensable tool for studying the behavior of this peptide at the atomistic level. General key aspects of {MD} simulations are the force field used for modeling the peptide and its environment, which is important for accurate modeling of the system of interest, and the length of the simulations, which determines whether or not equilibrium is reached. In this study we address these points by analyzing 30-μs {MD} simulations acquired for Aβ40 using seven different force fields. We assess the convergence of these simulations based on the convergence of various structural properties and of {NMR} and fluorescence spectroscopic observables. Moreover, we calculate Markov state models for the different {MD} simulations, which provide an unprecedented view of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the amyloid-β peptide. This further allows us to provide answers for pertinent questions, like: which force fields are suitable for modeling Aβ? (a99SB-{UCB} and a99SB-{ILDN}/{TIP}4P-D); what does Aβ peptide really look like? (mostly extended and disordered) and; how long does it take {MD} simulations of Aβ to attain equilibrium? (at least 20–30 μs). We believe the analyses presented in this study will provide a useful reference guide for important questions relating to the structure and dynamics of Aβ in particular, and by extension other similar disordered proteins.},

	abstract = {Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli remains one of the most important pathogens infecting children and it is one of the main causes of persistent diarrhea worldwide. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is capable of forming biofilms. Several E. coli mechanisms are regulated by quorum sensing, including virulence factors and biofilm formation. Quorum sensing is the communication system of bacteria with the ability to respond to chemical molecules known as autoinducers. Suppressor of division inhibitor ({SdiA}) is a quorum sensing receptor present in enteropathogenic E. coli in humans that detect acyl-homoserine lactone type autoinducers. {SdiA} receptor can also respond to autoinducers produced by other bacterial species that control cell division and virulence. {SdiA} is regulated by 1-octanoyl-rac-glycerol, which serves as an energy source, signaling molecule, and substrate for membrane biogenesis. {SdiA} is a potential target, which can be used as an anti-infectious technique. Current crystallographic structures for virtual screening may not be sufficient for molecular docking. So they are not very predictive, because the structures are in the active form. It has been shown that {SdiA} protein is not activated without a ligand. Generally, ligands bind to the ligand binding domain of {SdiA}. We employ Markov modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the behaviour of {SdiA} protein and find the possible inactive form. We find an unknown conformation after 24 molecular dynamics simulation runs with random initial velocities and Markov state modeling. In summary, using molecular simulations and Markov state modeling, we have obtained an unknown conformation, which is not available in the crystallographic structures of {SdiA}. This unknown conformation could be the structure of the inactive form without a ligand. The obtained ensemble structures could be used for virtual screening.},

Based on extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we constructed quasi-Markov State Model ({qMSM}) to reveal the dynamics during recognition at position 6-7 in the seed region of human Argonaute 2 ({hAgo}2). Interestingly, we found that the slowest mode of motion therein is not the {gRNA}-target base-pairing, but the coordination of the target phosphate groups with a set of positively charged residues of {hAgo}2. Moreover, the ability of Helix-7 to approach the {PIWI} and {MID} domains was found to reduce the effective volume accessible to the target {mRNA} and therefore facilitate both the backbone coordination and base-pair formation. Further mutant simulations revealed that alanine mutation of the D358 residue on Helix-7 enhanced a trap state to slow down the loading of target {mRNA}. Similar trap state was also observed when wobble pairs were introduced in g6 and g7, indicating the role of Helix-7 in suppressing non-canonical base-paring. Our study pointed to a general mechanism for {mRNA} recognition by eukaryotic Agos and demonstrated the promise of {qMSM} in investigating complex conformational changes of biomolecular systems.},

A fundamental understanding of the sequence-dependent kinetics and mechanisms of hybridization and dehybridization remains comparatively underdeveloped. In this work, we establish new understanding of the sequence-dependent hybridization/dehybridization kinetics and mechanism within a family of self-complementary pairs of 10-mer {DNA} oligomers by integrating coarse-grained molecular simulation, machine learning of the slow dynamical modes, data-driven inference of long-time kinetic models, and experimental temperature-jump infrared spectroscopy. For a repetitive {ATATATATAT} sequence, we resolve a rugged dynamical landscape comprising multiple metastable states, numerous competing hybridization/dehybridization pathways, and a spectrum of dynamical relaxations. Introduction of a G:C pair at the terminus ({GATATATATC}) or center ({ATATGCATAT}) of the sequence reduces the ruggedness of the dynamics landscape by eliminating a number of metastable states and reducing the number of competing dynamical pathways. Only by introducing a G:C pair midway between the terminus and the center to maximally disrupt the repetitive nature of the sequence ({ATGATATCAT}) do we recover a canonical “all-or-nothing” two-state model of hybridization/dehybridization with no intermediate metastable states. Our results establish new understanding of the dynamical richness of sequence-dependent kinetics and mechanisms of {DNA} hybridization/dehybridization by furnishing quantitative and predictive kinetic models of the dynamical transition network between metastable states, present a molecular basis with which to understand experimental temperature jump data, and furnish foundational design rules by which to rationally engineer the kinetics and pathways of {DNA} association and dissociation for {DNA} nanotechnology applications.},

	abstract = {Alsin is a protein of 1,657 amino acids known for its crucial role in vesicular trafficking in neurons thanks to its ability to interact with two guanosine triphosphatases, Rac1 and Rab5. Evidence suggests that Rac1 can bind Alsin central region, composed by a Dbl Homology ({DH}) domain followed by a Pleckstrin Homology ({PH}) domain, leading to Alsin relocalization. However, Alsin three-dimensional structure and its relationship with known biological functions of this protein are still unknown. In this work, a homology model of the Alsin {DH}/{PH} domain was developed and studied through molecular dynamics both in the presence and in the absence of its binding partner, Rac1. Due to different conformations of {DH} domain, the presence of Rac1 seems to stabilize an open state of the protein, while the absence of its binding partner results in closed conformations. Furthermore, Rac1 interaction was able to reduce the fluctuations in the second conserved region of {DH} motif, which may be involved in the formation of a homodimer. Moreover, the dynamics of {DH}/{PH} was described through a Markov State Model to study the pathways linking the open and closed states. In conclusion, this work provided an all-atom model for the {DH}/{PH} domain of Alsin protein; moreover, molecular dynamics investigations suggested underlying molecular mechanisms in the signal transduction between Rac1 and Alsin, providing the basis for a deeper understanding of the whole structure–function relationship for Alsin protein.},

The ligands can regulate the volume of the activation function-2 through the residues Phe737 and Gln738.

	abstract = {Cyclic peptides have the potential to vastly extend the scope of druggable proteins and lead to new therapeutics for currently untreatable diseases. However, cyclic peptides often suffer from poor bioavailability. To uncover design principles for permeable cyclic peptides, a promising strategy is to analyze the conformational dynamics of the peptides using molecular dynamics ({MD}) and Markov state models ({MSMs}). Previous {MD} studies have focused on the conformational dynamics in pure aqueous or apolar environments to rationalize membrane permeability. However, during the key steps of the permeation through the membrane, cyclic peptides are exposed to interfaces between polar and apolar regions. Recent studies revealed that these interfaces constitute the free energy minima of the permeation process. Thus, a deeper understanding of the behavior of cyclic peptides at polar/apolar interfaces is desired. Here, we investigate the conformational and kinetic behavior of cyclic decapeptides at a water/chloroform interface using unbiased {MD} simulations and {MSMs}. The distinct environments at the interface alter the conformational equilibrium as well as the interconversion kinetics of cyclic peptide conformations. For peptides with low population of the permeable conformation in aqueous solution, the polar/apolar interface facilitates the interconversion to the closed conformation, which is required for membrane permeation. Comparison to unbiased {MD} simulations with a {POPC} bilayer reveals that not only the conformations but also the orientations are relevant in a membrane system. These findings allow us to propose a permeability model that includes both ‘prefolding’ and ‘non-prefolding’ cyclic peptides – an extension that can lead to new design considerations for permeable cyclic peptides.},

This is due to the several unique features in the {AsLOV}2, such as the monomeric structure of the protein in both light and dark states and the relatively short transition time between the two states. Despite that, not many studies focus on the effect of the secondary structures on the drastic conformational change between the light and dark states. In this study, we focus on the role of A’α helix as a key player in the transition between both states using various computational tools as: 1.5 μs molecular dynamics simulations for each configuration, Markov state model, different machine learning techniques, and community analysis. The impact of the A’α helix was studied on the atomistic level by introducing two groups of mutations, helicity enhancing mutations (T406A and T407A) and helicity disrupting mutations (L408D and R410P), as well as on the overall secondary structure by using the community analysis. Maintaining the N-terminal hydrogen bond network was found to be essential for the transition between the two states. Via in-depth hydrogen bonding and contact analysis we were able to identify key residues (Thr407 and Arg410) involved in the functional conformational switch and their impact on the overall protein dynamics. Moreover, the community analysis highlighted the significant role of the β sheets in the overall protein allosteric process.},

	abstract = {We develop an approach to characterize the effects of gating by a multiconformation protein consisting of macrostate conformations that are either accessible or inaccessible to ligand binding. We first construct a Markov state model of the apo-protein from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations from which we identify macrostates and their conformations, compute their relative macrostate populations and interchange kinetics, and structurally characterize them in terms of ligand accessibility. We insert the calculated first-order rate constants for conformational transitions into a multistate gating theory from which we derive a gating factor γ that quantifies the degree of conformational gating. Applied to {HIV}-1 protease, our approach yields a kinetic network of three accessible (semi-open, open, and wide-open) and two inaccessible (closed and a newly identified, “parted”) macrostate conformations. The parted conformation sterically partitions the active site, suggesting a possible role in product release. We find that the binding kinetics of drugs and drug-like inhibitors to {HIV}-1 protease falls in the slow gating regime. However, because γ = 0.75, conformational gating only modestly slows ligand binding. Brownian dynamics simulations of the diffusional association of eight inhibitors to the protease─having a wide range of experimental association constants (∼104–1010 M–1 s–1)─yields gated rate constants in the range of ∼0.5–5.7 × 108 M–1 s–1. This indicates that, whereas the association rate of some inhibitors could be described by the model, for many inhibitors either subsequent conformational transitions or alternate binding mechanisms may be rate-limiting. For systems known to be modulated by conformational gating, the approach could be scaled computationally efficiently to screen association kinetics for a large number of ligands.},

These oligomeric structures may also serve as templates for studying oligomerization of other class A {GPCRs}. Our simulation data revealed that receptor activation results in enhanced oligomerization, more diverse oligomer populations, and a more connected oligomerization network. The active state conformation of the A2aR shifts protein-protein association interfaces to those involving intracellular loop {ICL}3 and transmembrane helix {TM}6. Binding of {PIP}2 to A2aR stabilizes protein-protein interactions via {PIP}2-mediated association interfaces. These results indicate that A2aR oligomerization is responsive to the local membrane lipid environment. This, in turn, suggests a modulatory effect on A2aR whereby a given oligomerization profile favors the dynamic formation of specific supramolecular signaling complexes.},

	abstract = {As the current biotherapeutic market is dominated by antibodies, the design of different antibody formats, like bispecific antibodies, is critical to the advancement of the field. In contrast to monovalent antibodies, which consist of two identical antigen-binding sites, bispecific antibodies can target two different epitopes by containing two different antigen-binding sites. Thus, the rise of new formats as successful therapeutics has reignited the interest in advancing and facilitating the efficient production of bispecific antibodies. Here, we investigate the influence of point mutations in the antigen-binding site, the paratope, on heavy and light chain pairing preferences by using molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with experiments, we find that specific residues in the antibody variable domain (Fv), i.e., the complementarity-determining region ({CDR}) L3 and H3 loops, determine heavy and light chain pairing preferences. Excitingly, we observe substantial population shifts in {CDR}-H3 and {CDR}-L3 loop conformations in solution accompanied by a decrease in bispecific {IgG} yield. These conformational changes in the {CDR}3 loops induced by point mutations also influence all other {CDR} loop conformations and consequentially result in different {CDR} loop states in solution. However, besides their effect on the obtained {CDR} loop ensembles, point mutations also lead to distinct interaction patterns in the {VH}-{VL} interface. By comparing the interaction patterns among all investigated variants, we observe specific contacts in the interface that drive heavy and light chain pairing. Thus, these findings have broad implications in the field of antibody engineering and design because they provide a mechanistic understanding of antibody interfaces, by identifying critical factors driving the pairing preferences, and thus can help to advance the design of bispecific antibodies.},

	abstract = {This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of {CLC}-2 “fast” (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation. In the starting conformation of our {CLC}-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-{EM} structure of the bovine {CLC}-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue {GLUex}. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient {GLUex} away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of {GLUex} results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low (∼1\%), consistent with the low open probability of {CLC}-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 {mV}). In the second additional state, {GLUex} rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population (∼1\%), is only accessible when {GLUex} is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the {CLC}-2 selectivity filter, as a function of {GLUex} protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of {CLC}-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.},

This approach turned out to be surprisingly useful for analyzing state-of-the-art computer simulations of the thermosensitive coil–globule transition of N-Isopropylacrylamide 20-mer. Our atomistic computer simulations are orders of magnitude longer than those of previous studies and lead to a reliable description of thermodynamics and kinetics at many different temperatures. The freely jointed chain model provides a coordinate system, which allows us to construct a Markov state model of the conformational transitions. Furthermore, this guarantees a reliable reconstruction of the kinetics in back-and-forth directions. In addition, we obtain a description of the high diversity and variability of both conformational states. Thus, we gain a detailed understanding of the coil–globule transition. Surprisingly, conformational entropy turns out to play only a minor role in the thermodynamic balance of the process. Moreover, we show that the radius of gyration is an unexpectedly unsuitable coordinate to comprehend the transition kinetics because it does not capture the high conformational diversity within the different states. Consequently, the approach presented here allows for an exhaustive description and resolution of the conformational ensembles of arbitrary linear polymer chains.},

	abstract = {The therapeutic potential of cannabinoid receptors is not fully explored due to psychoactive side effects and lack of selectivity associated with orthosteric ligands. Allosteric modulators have the potential to become selective therapeutics for cannabinoid receptors. Biochemical experiments have shown the effects of the allosteric Na+ binding on cannabinoid receptor activity. However, the Na+ coordination site and binding pathway are still unknown. Here, we perform molecular dynamic simulations to explore Na+ binding in the cannabinoid receptors, {CB}1 and {CB}2. Simulations reveal that Na+ binds to the primary binding site from different extracellular sites for {CB}1 and {CB}2. A distinct secondary Na+ coordination site is identified in {CB}1 that is not present in {CB}2. Furthermore, simulations also show that intracellular Na+ could bind to the Na+ binding site in {CB}1. Constructed Markov state models show that the standard free energy of Na+ binding is similar to the previously calculated free energy for other class A {GPCRs}.},

For many channels, the details of gating remain unclear, partly due to limited structural data and simulation timescales. Here, we used enhanced sampling to simulate the {pH}-gated channel {GLIC}, and construct Markov state models ({MSMs}) of gating. Consistent with new functional recordings, we report in oocytes, our analysis revealed differential effects of protonation and mutation on free-energy wells. Clustering of closed- versus open-like states enabled estimation of open probabilities and transition rates, while higher-order clustering affirmed conformational trends in gating. Furthermore, our models uncovered state- and protonation-dependent symmetrization. This demonstrates the applicability of {MSMs} to map energetic and conformational transitions between ion-channel functional states, and how they reproduce shifts upon activation or mutation, with implications for modeling neuronal function and developing state-selective drugs.},

	abstract = {The Ras family of proteins is known to play an important role in cellular signal transduction. The oncoprotein Ras is also found to be mutated in {\textasciitilde}90\% of the pancreatic cancers, of which G12V, G13V, A59G and Q61L are the known hot-spot mutants. These ubiquitous proteins fall in the family of G-proteins, and hence switches between active {GTP} bound and inactive {GDP} bound states, which is hindered in most of its oncogenic mutant counterparts. Moreover, Ras being a {GTPase} has an intrinsic property to hydrolyze {GTP} to {GDP}, which is obstructed due to mutations and lends the mutants stuck in constitutively active state leading to oncogenic behavior. In this regard, the present study aims to understand the dynamics involved in the hot-spot mutant A59G-Ras using long 10μs classical {MD} simulations (5μs for each of the wild-type and mutant systems) and comparing the same with its wild-type counterpart. Advanced analytics using Markov State Model ({MSM}) based approach has been deployed to comparatively understand the transition path for the wild-type and mutant systems. Roles of crucial residues like Tyr32, Gln61 and Tyr64 have also been established using multivariate {PCA} analyses. Furthermore, this multivariate {PCA} analysis also provides crucial features which may be used as reaction coordinates for biased simulations for further studies. The absence of formation of pre-hydrolysis network is also reported for the mutant conformation, using the distance-based analyses (between crucial residues) of the conserved regions. The implications of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the disruption of the pre-hydrolysis network in the mutant A59G ensemble might lead to permanently active oncogenic conformation in the mutant conformers.},

	abstract = {{RNA} dependent {RNA} polymerase ({RdRP}) from positive-stranded {RNA} viruses has always been a hot target for designing of new drugs. Major class of drugs that are targeted against {RdRP} are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides ({NTPs}) and its analogues leading to significant structural variation in the {RdRP} has been presented here. {RdRP} simulations in its apo, {NTP}-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the {RdRP} molecule has been explored using principal component ({PCA}) and Markov state modeling ({MSM}) analysis. {PCA} inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of {RdRP}. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent {RNA} template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. {MSM} analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the {RdRP}. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism of these drugs by combining experiments and simulations. In vitro assays confirm that both drugs inhibit the human protein {TMPRSS}2, a {SARS}-Cov-2 spike protein activator. As no experimental structure is available, we provide a model of the {TMPRSS}2 equilibrium structure and its fluctuations by relaxing an initial homology structure with extensive 330 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics ({MD}) and Markov modeling. Through Markov modeling, we describe the binding process of both drugs and a metabolic product of camostat ({GBPA}) to {TMPRSS}2, reaching a Michaelis complex ({MC}) state, which precedes the formation of a long-lived covalent inhibitory state. We find that nafamostat has a higher {MC} population than camostat and {GBPA}, suggesting that nafamostat is more readily available to form the stable covalent enzyme–substrate intermediate, effectively explaining its high potency. This model is backed by our in vitro experiments and consistent with previous virus cell entry assays.

	abstract = {The formation of neurofibrillary tangles ({NFT}) by abnormal aggregation of misfolded microtubule-associated protein tau is a hallmark of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains unclear how tau monomers undergo conformational changes and further lead to the abnormal aggregation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation combined with the Markov state model ({MSM}) analysis was used to uncover the misfolding progress and structural characteristics of the key R3 fragment of tau protein at the atomic level. The simulation results show that R3 exists in disordered structures mainly, which is consistent with the experimental results. The {MSM} analysis identified multiple β-sheet conformations of R3. The residues involved in the β-sheet structure formation are mainly located in three regions: {PHF}6 at the N-terminal, S324 to N327 at the middle of R3, and K331 to G334 at the C-terminal. In addition, the path analysis of the formation of the β-sheet structure by transition path theory ({TPT}) revealed that there are multiple paths to form β-sheet structures from the disordered state, and the timescales are at the millisecond level, indicating that a large number of structural rearrangements occur during the formation of β-sheet structures. It is interesting to note that S19 is a critical intermediate state for the formation of two target β-sheet structures, S23 and S4. In S19, three regions of V306 to K311, C322 to G326, and K331 to G334 form a turn structure, the regions that form the β-sheet structure in target states S23 and S4, indicating that the formation of a turn structure is necessary to form a β-sheet structure and then the turn structure will eventually transform into the β-sheet structure through key hydrogen bonding interactions. These findings can provide insights into the kinetics of tau protein misfolding.},

Here we use molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state models to sample transitions between active and inactive states.

For the first time, we directly observe sodium-induced conformational changes in long-timescale computer simulations. Thereby, we are able to explain the resulting change in activity. We observe a stabilization of the active form in presence of Na+ and a shift towards the inactive form in Na+-free simulations. We identify key structural features to quantify and monitor this conformational shift. These include the accessibility of the S1 pocket and the reorientation of W215, of R221a and of the Na+ loop. The structural characteristics exhibit dynamics at various timescales: Conformational changes in the Na+ binding loop constitute the slowest observed movement. Depending on its orientation, it induces conformational shifts in the nearby substrate binding site. Only after this shift, residue W215 is able to move freely, allowing thrombin to adopt a binding-competent conformation.},

	abstract = {Characterizing and understanding the antibody binding interface have become a pre-requisite for rational antibody design and engineering. The antigen-binding site is formed by six hypervariable loops, known as the complementarity determining regions ({CDRs}) and by the relative interdomain orientation ({VH}–{VL}). Antibody {CDR} loops with a certain sequence have been thought to be limited to a single static canonical conformation determining their binding properties. However, it has been shown that antibodies exist as ensembles of multiple paratope states, which are defined by a characteristic combination of {CDR} loop conformations and interdomain orientations. In this study, we thermodynamically and kinetically characterize the prominent role of residue 71H (Chothia nomenclature), which does not only codetermine the canonical conformation of the {CDR}-H2 loop but also results in changes in conformational diversity and population shifts of the {CDR}-H1 and {CDR}-H3 loop. As all {CDR} loop movements are correlated, conformational rearrangements of the heavy chain {CDR} loops also induce conformational changes in the {CDR}-L1, {CDR}-L2, and {CDR}-L3 loop. These overall conformational changes of the {CDR} loops also influence the interface angle distributions, consequentially leading to different paratope states in solution. Thus, the type of residue of 71H, either an alanine or an arginine, not only influences the {CDR}-H2 loop ensembles, but co-determines the paratope states in solution. Characterization of the functional consequences of mutations of residue 71H on the paratope states and interface orientations has broad implications in the field of antibody engineering.},

We identify multiple binding sites and compare these to aggregation prone regions. Additionally, we calculate the lifetime of the protein-excipient complex.

We establish that the lifetime of the complex between {IFN} and glycyl-D-asparagine is extremely short.

In addition, risperidone occupies a sub-pocket near the Na+ binding site, whereas eticlopride does not. Based on these findings and our experimental results, we propose that the divergent receptor conformations stabilized by Na+-sensitive eticlopride and Na+-insensitive risperidone correspond to different degrees of inverse agonism.

	abstract = {The weighted ensemble ({WE}) simulation strategy provides unbiased sampling of nonequilibrium processes, such as molecular folding or binding, but the extraction of rate constants relies on characterizing steady-state behavior. Unfortunately, {WE} simulations of sufficiently complex systems will not relax to steady state on observed simulation times. Here, we show that a postsimulation clustering of molecular configurations into “microbins” using methods developed in the Markov State Model ({MSM}) community can yield unbiased kinetics from {WE} data before steady-state convergence of the {WE} simulation itself. Because {WE} trajectories are directional and not equilibrium distributed, the history-augmented {MSM} ({haMSM}) formulation can be used, which yields the mean first-passage time ({MFPT}) without bias for arbitrarily small lag times. Accurate kinetics can be obtained while bypassing the often prohibitive convergence requirements of the nonequilibrium weighted ensemble. We validate the method in a simple diffusive process on a two-dimensional (2D) random energy landscape and then analyze atomistic protein folding simulations using {WE} molecular dynamics. We report significant progress toward the unbiased estimation of protein folding times and pathways, though key challenges remain.},

	abstract = {{SIRT}6 belongs to the conserved {NAD}+-dependent deacetylase superfamily and mediates multiple biological and pathological processes. Targeting {SIRT}6 by allosteric modulators represents a novel direction for therapeutics, which can overcome the selectivity problem caused by the structural similarity of orthosteric sites among deacetylases. Here, developing a reversed allosteric strategy {AlloReverse}, we identified a cryptic allosteric site, Pocket Z, which was only induced by the bi-directional allosteric signal triggered upon orthosteric binding of {NAD}+. Based on Pocket Z, we discovered an {SIRT}6 allosteric inhibitor named {JYQ}-42. {JYQ}-42 selectively targets {SIRT}6 among other histone deacetylases and effectively inhibits {SIRT}6 deacetylation, with an {IC}50 of 2.33 μmol/L. {JYQ}-42 significantly suppresses {SIRT}6-mediated cancer cell migration and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. {JYQ}-42, to our knowledge, is the most potent and selective allosteric {SIRT}6 inhibitor. This study provides a novel strategy for allosteric drug design and will help in the challenging development of therapeutic agents that can selectively bind {SIRT}6.},

One major obstacle is, however, their often relatively poor bioavailability. Here, we investigate the structure–permeability relationship of 24 cyclic decapeptides that share the same backbone N-methylation pattern but differ in their side chains. The peptides cover a large range of values for passive membrane permeability as well as lipophilicity and solubility. To rationalize the observed differences in permeability, we extracted for each peptide the population of the membrane-permeable conformation in water from extensive explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations and used this as a metric for conformational rigidity or “prefolding.” The insights from the simulations together with lipophilicity measurements highlight the intricate interplay between polarity/lipophilicity and flexibility/rigidity and the possible compensating effects on permeability. The findings allow us to better understand the structure–permeability relationship of cyclic peptides and extract general guiding principles.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, antibodies have emerged as one of the most important and successful classes of biopharmaceuticals. The highest variability and diversity of an antibody is concentrated on six hypervariable loops, also known as complementarity determining regions ({CDRs}) shaping the antigen-binding site, the paratope. Whereas it was assumed that certain sequences can only adopt a limited set of backbone conformations, in this study we present a kinetic classification of several paratope states in solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations in combination with experimental structural information we capture the involved conformational transitions between different canonical clusters and additional dominant solution structures occurring in the micro-to-millisecond timescale. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation of {CDR} loop movements. Another important aspect when characterizing different paratope states is the relative {VH}/{VL} orientation and the influence of the distinct {CDR} loop states on the {VH}/{VL} interface. Conformational rearrangements of the {CDR} loops do not only have an effect on the relative {VH}/{VL} orientations, but also influence in some cases the elbow-angle dynamics and shift the respective distributions. Thus, our results show that antibodies exist as several interconverting paratope states, each contributing to the antibody’s properties.},

	abstract = {The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 coronavirus outbreak continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. The main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-{COVID}-19 agents. Unexpected difficulties have been encountered in the design of specific inhibitors. Here, by analyzing an ensemble of ∼30 000 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro conformations from crystallographic studies and molecular simulations, we show that small structural variations in the binding site dramatically impact ligand binding properties. Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By performing ∼200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we redefine the protein’s druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding. This procedure revealed a unique {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro blueprint that led to a definition of a specific structure-based pharmacophore. The latter explains the poor transferability of potent {SARS}-{CoV} Mpro inhibitors to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro, despite the identical sequences of the active sites. Importantly, application of the pharmacophore predicted novel high affinity inhibitors of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro, that were validated by in vitro assays performed here and by a newly solved X-ray crystal structure. These results provide a strong basis for effective rational drug design campaigns against {SARS}-{CoV}-2 Mpro and a new computational approach to screen protein targets with malleable binding sites.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has been responsible for several deaths worldwide. The causative agent behind this disease is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome – novel Coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2). {SARS}-{CoV}-2 belongs to the category of {RNA} viruses. The main protease, responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein is considered as one of the hot targets for treating {COVID}-19. Earlier reports suggest the use of {HIV} anti-viral drugs for targeting the main protease of {SARS}-{CoV}, which caused {SARS} in the year 2002–2003. Hence, drug repurposing approach may prove to be useful in targeting the main protease of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. The high-resolution crystal structure of the main protease of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 ({PDB} {ID}: 6LU7) was used as the target. The Food and Drug Administration approved and {SWEETLEAD} database of drug molecules were screened. The apo form of the main protease was simulated for a cumulative of 150 ns and 10 μs open-source simulation data was used, to obtain conformations for ensemble docking. The representative structures for docking were selected using {RMSD}-based clustering and Markov State Modeling analysis. This ensemble docking approach for the main protease helped in exploring the conformational variation in the drug-binding site of the main protease leading to the efficient binding of more relevant drug molecules. The drugs obtained as top hits from the ensemble docking possessed anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. This in silico ensemble docking approach would support the identification of potential candidates for repurposing against {COVID}-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

Here, we use a combination of single molecule fluorescence, molecular dynamics, functional assays, and conformational sensors to reveal that distinct {TMD} assembly properties drive differences between {mGluR} subtypes. We uncover a variable region within transmembrane helix 4 ({TM}4) that contributes to homo- and heterodimerization in a subtype-specific manner and tunes orthosteric, allosteric, and basal activation. We also confirm a critical role for a conserved inter-{TM}6 interface in stabilizing the active state during orthosteric or allosteric activation. Together this study shows that inter-{TMD} assembly and dynamic rearrangement drive {mGluR} function with distinct properties between subtypes.},

Both {VSDs} displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model; however, they greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Specifically, stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics.

The {PUL} is specifically upregulated in the presence of complex arabinoxylans. We characterize some of the esterases biochemically and structurally, and show that they release ferulic acid from complex arabinoxylans.

An important factor to reach this goal is induced electronic polarization, which is likely to impact the permeation rate of small ions through narrow molecular pores. In this work, we extended the recently developed polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillators to assess the role of induced polarization effects on the energetics of sodium and potassium ion transport across the gramicidin A ({gA}) ion channel. The inclusion of induced polarization lowers barriers present in 1D potential of mean force ({PMF}) for cation permeation by ∼50\% compared to those obtained with the additive force field. Conductance properties calculated with 1D {PMFs} from Drude simulations are in better agreement with experimental results. Polarization of single-file water molecules and protein atoms forming the narrow pore has a direct impact on the free-energy barriers and cation-specific solid-state {NMR} chemical shifts. Sensitivity analysis indicates that small changes to water–channel interactions can alter the free energy barrier for ion permeation. These results, illustrating polarization effects present in the complex electrostatic environment of the {gA} channel, have broad implications for revising proposed mechanisms of ion permeation and selectivity in a variety of ion channels.},

The identification of broadly neutralizing antibody classes that can neutralize viral escape mutants is critical for universal influenza virus vaccine design. Here we report a distinct class of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target a discrete membrane-proximal anchor epitope of the haemagglutinin stalk domain. Anchor epitope-targeting antibodies are broadly neutralizing across H1 viruses and can cross-react with H2 and H5 viruses that are a pandemic threat. Antibodies that target this anchor epitope utilize a highly restricted repertoire, which encodes two public binding motifs that make extensive contacts with conserved residues in the fusion peptide. Moreover, anchor epitope-targeting B cells are common in the human memory B cell repertoire and were recalled in humans by an oil-in-water adjuvanted chimeric haemagglutinin vaccine4,5, which is a potential universal influenza virus vaccine. To maximize protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, vaccines should aim to boost this previously untapped source of broadly neutralizing antibodies that are widespread in the human memory B cell pool.},

A complete mechanistic elucidation of large-scale conformational transitions underlying the activation mechanisms of {GPCRs} is of critical importance for therapeutic drug development. Here, we apply a combined computational and experimental framework integrating extensive molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational biosensors to investigate the conformational landscape of the angiotensin {II} ({AngII}) type 1 receptor ({AT}1 receptor) — a prototypical class A {GPCR}—activation. Our findings suggest a synergistic transition mechanism for {AT}1 receptor activation. A key intermediate state is identified in the activation pathway, which possesses a cryptic binding site within the intracellular region of the receptor. Mutation of this cryptic site prevents activation of the downstream G protein signaling and β-arrestin-mediated pathways by the endogenous {AngII} octapeptide agonist, suggesting an allosteric regulatory mechanism. Together, these findings provide a deeper understanding of {AT}1 receptor activation at an atomic level and suggest avenues for the design of allosteric {AT}1 receptor modulators with a broad range of applications in {GPCR} biology, biophysics, and medicinal chemistry.},

	abstract = {Gradient descent optimization algorithms, while increasingly popular, are often used as black-box optimizers, as practical explanations of their strengths and weaknesses are hard to come by. This article aims to provide the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing gradient descent.},

	abstract = {We consider image transformation problems, where an input image is transformed into an output image. Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a {\textbackslash}emph\{per-pixel\} loss between the output and ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality images can be generated by defining and optimizing {\textbackslash}emph\{perceptual\} loss functions based on high-level features extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives visually pleasing results.},

Setting the hyper-parameters remains a black art that requires years of experience to acquire. This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums. Files to help replicate the results reported here are available.},

	shorttitle = {Hidden Markov and semi-Markov models},
	abstract = {Hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) and their extensions have proven to be powerful tools for classification of observations that stem from systems with temporal dependence as they take into account that observations close in time are likely generated from the same state (i.e.{\textbackslash} class). When information on the classes of the observations is available in advanced, supervised methods can be applied. In this paper, we provide details for the implementation of four models for classification in a supervised learning context: {HMMs}, hidden semi-Markov models ({HSMMs}), autoregressive-{HMMs}, and autoregressive-{HSMMs}. Using simulations, we study the classification performance under various degrees of model misspecification to characterize when it would be important to extend a basic {HMM} to an {HSMM}. As an application of these techniques we use the models to classify accelerometer data from Merino sheep to distinguish between four different behaviors of interest. In particular in the field of movement ecology, collection of fine-scale animal movement data over time to identify behavioral states has become ubiquitous, necessitating models that can account for the dependence structure in the data. We demonstrate that when the aim is to conduct classification, various degrees of model misspecification of the proposed model may not impede good classification performance unless there is high overlap between the state-dependent distributions, that is, unless the observation distributions of the different states are difficult to differentiate.},

	abstract = {The non-equilibrium principles and methods which are fundamental to understanding modern physics, biology, and chemistry can be intimidating.  The key to learning them is working through simple, concrete examples.  The beginner must do calculations by hand to truly grasp how the equations and ideas work together.  Hence, seven sets of homework problems are given -- using two and three-state model chemical systems -- along with introductory discussion, complete solutions, and links to further discussion.  The problems use simple math and graphics to introduce equilibrium, relaxation, non-equilibrium steady states and the associated timescales, using discrete and continuous state spaces as well as continuous and discrete time (``Markov state models'').  The relationship between these descriptions is explained.  The overall aim is to provide a set of easily approachable material that will significantly increase the student's confidence in approaching more advanced material.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been successful in automating the design of features in machine learning pipelines. However, the algorithms optimizing neural network parameters remain largely hand-designed and computationally inefficient. We study if we can use deep learning to directly predict these parameters by exploiting the past knowledge of training other networks. We introduce a large-scale dataset of diverse computational graphs of neural architectures - {DeepNets}-1M - and use it to explore parameter prediction on {CIFAR}-10 and {ImageNet}. By leveraging advances in graph neural networks, we propose a hypernetwork that can predict performant parameters in a single forward pass taking a fraction of a second, even on a {CPU}. The proposed model achieves surprisingly good performance on unseen and diverse networks. For example, it is able to predict all 24 million parameters of a {ResNet}-50 achieving a 60\% accuracy on {CIFAR}-10. On {ImageNet}, top-5 accuracy of some of our networks approaches 50\%. Our task along with the model and results can potentially lead to a new, more computationally efficient paradigm of training networks. Our model also learns a strong representation of neural architectures enabling their analysis.},

	abstract = {Interest in atomically detailed simulations has grown signiﬁcantly with recent advances in computational hardware and Markov state modeling ({MSM}) methods, yet outstanding questions remain that hinder their widespread adoption. Namely, how do alternative sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this inﬂuence predictions generated from the data? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used sampling methods: (1) a single long simulation, (2) many short simulations run in parallel, (3) adaptive sampling, and (4) our recently developed goal-oriented sampling algorithm, {FAST}. We ﬁrst develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering select states on simple landscapes, where we uncover the drastic eﬀects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize the probability of discovering particular states and transition pathways for each of the four methods. Consistently, we ﬁnd that {FAST} simulations discover each target state with the highest probability, while traversing realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the potential pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate. We refer to this pathology as “pathway tunneling”. To protect against this phenomenon when using adaptive-sampling and {FAST} simulations, we introduce the {FAST}-string method. This method enhances sampling along the highest-ﬂux transition paths to reﬁne an {MSMs} transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare the performance of a variety of {MSM} estimators in describing accurate thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend simply normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding small pseudocounts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate whether our insights from simple landscapes hold for allatom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the λ-repressor protein. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that {FAST}-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as a set of long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.},

Low-resolution experimental techniques provide valuable structural information on biomolecule at near-native conditions, which are often combined with molecular simulations to determine and refine protein structural ensembles. In this study, we demonstrate how small angle x-ray scattering ({SAXS}) information can be incorporated in Markov state model-based adaptive sampling strategy to enhance time efficiency of unbiased {MD} simulations and identify functionally relevant conformations of proteins and complexes. Our results show that using {SAXS} data combined with additional information, such as thermodynamics and distance restraints, we are able to distinguish otherwise degenerate structures due to the inherent ambiguity of {SAXS} pattern. We further demonstrate that adaptive sampling guided by {SAXS} and hybrid information can significantly reduce the computation time required to discover target structures. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach in predicting near-native structures of proteins and complexes. Other low-resolution experimental information can be incorporated in a similar manner to collectively enhance unbiased sampling and improve the accuracy of structure prediction from simulation.},

In this paper, we extend the methodology toward efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states is found in both the wild type (baseline) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type. We first benchmark our methodology by recapturing alanine dipeptide dynamics across a range of different atomistic force fields, including the polarizable Amoeba force field, after learning a set of slow modes using Amber ff99sb-{ILDN}. We next extend the method by including structural data from the wild type simulation and apply the technique to recapturing the effects of the {GTT} mutation on the {FIP}35 {WW} domain.},

In molecular dynamics simulations, these data-driven collective variables capture the slowest modes of the dynamics and are useful for enhanced sampling and free energy estimation. In this work, we employ {SRV} coordinates as a feature set for Markov state model ({MSM}) construction. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, {MSMs} constructed from {SRV} coordinates are more robust to the choice of input features, exhibit faster implied time scale convergence, and permit the use of shorter lagtimes to construct higher kinetic resolution models. We apply this methodology to study the folding kinetics and conformational landscape of the Trp-cage miniprotein. Folding and unfolding mean first passage times are in good agreement with the prior literature, and a nine macrostate model is presented. The unfolded ensemble comprises a central kinetic hub with interconversions to several metastable unfolded conformations and which serves as the gateway to the folded ensemble. The folded ensemble comprises the native state, a partially unfolded intermediate “loop” state, and a previously unreported short-lived intermediate that we were able to resolve due to the high time resolution of the {SRV}-{MSM}. We propose {SRVs} as an excellent candidate for integration into modern {MSM} construction pipelines.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopic techniques such as Trp–Tyr quenching, luminescence resonance energy transfer, and triplet–triplet energy transfer are widely used for understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins. These experiments measure the relaxation of a particular labeled set of residue pairs, and the choice of residue pairs requires careful thought. As a result, experimentalists must pick residue pairs from a large pool of possibilities. In the current work, we show that molecular simulation datasets of protein dynamics can be used to systematically select an optimal set of residue positions to place probes for conducting spectroscopic experiments. The method described in this work, called Optimal Probes, can be used to rank trial sets of residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Optimal probes ensures two conditions: residue pairs capture the slow dynamics of the protein and their dynamics is not correlated for maximum information gain to score each trial set. Eventually, the highest scored set can be used for biophysical experiments to study the kinetics of the protein. The scoring methodology is based on kinetic network models of protein dynamics and a variational principle for molecular kinetics to optimize the hyperparameters used for the model. We also discuss that the scoring strategy used by Optimal Probes is the best possible way to ensure the ideal choice of residue pairs for experiments. We predict the best experimental probe positions for proteins λ-repressor, β2-adrenergic receptor, and villin headpiece domain. These proteins have been well-studied and allow for a rigorous comparison of Optimal Probes predictions with already available experiments. Additionally, we also illustrate that our method can be used to predict the best choice for experiments by including any previous experiment choices available from other studies on the same protein. We consistently find that the best choice cannot be based on intuition or structural information such as distance difference between few known stable structures of the protein. Therefore, we show that incorporating protein dynamics could be used to maximize the information gain from experiments.},

We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the {AMBER}-{FB}15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental {CLN}025 conformational ensemble, while the {AMBER} ff99SB-{ILDN} and {CHARMM}22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.},

The coarsegraining of {MSMs} into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here we present the minimum variance clustering approach ({MVCA}) for the coarse-graining of {MSMs} into macrostate models. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward’s minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics is determined using the Jensen−Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the {MSM} transition probability matrix. We ﬁrst show that {MVCA} produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system and is robust toward long-duration statistical artifacts. {MVCA} is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in diﬀerent force ﬁelds to demonstrate that a diﬀerent number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a data set containing many {MSMs} from simulations in diﬀerent force ﬁelds by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force ﬁeld parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen−Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.},

Several adaptive sampling strategies have been proposed, but it is not clear which methods perform better for different physical systems. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of selected adaptive sampling strategies on a wide selection of fast folding proteins. The adaptive sampling strategies were emulated using models constructed on already existing {MD} trajectories. We provide theoretical limits for the sampling speed-up and compare the performance of different strategies with and without using some a priori knowledge of the system. The results show that for different goals, different adaptive sampling strategies are optimal. In order to sample slow dynamical processes such as protein folding without a priori knowledge of the system, a strategy based on the identification of a set of metastable regions is consistently the most efficient, while a strategy based on the identification of microstates performs better if the goal is to explore newer regions of the conformational space. Interestingly, the maximum speed-up achievable for the adaptive sampling of slow processes increases for proteins with longer folding times, encouraging the application of these methods for the characterization of slower processes, beyond the fast-folding proteins considered here.},

While recent work from our group and others has demonstrated the utility of time-lagged covariate models to study such systems, linearity assumptions can limit the compression of inherently nonlinear dynamics into just a few characteristic components. Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of the variational autoencoder ({VAE}), which is able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged {VAE}, or variational dynamics encoder ({VDE}), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the {VDE} is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the {VDE} model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the {VDE} model to describe dynamics. The {VDE} presents an important step in applying techniques from deep learning to more accurately model and interpret complex biophysics.},

So far, geometric order parameters, such as the root mean square deviation, fraction of native amino acid contacts, and collective coordinates that best characterize rare or large conformational transitions, have been prevailing in protein folding studies. Here, we show that the solvent-averaged effective energy, which is a thermodynamic quantity but unambiguously defined for individual protein conformations, serves as a good order parameter of protein folding. This is illustrated through the application to the folding-unfolding simulation trajectory of villin headpiece subdomain. We rationalize the suitability of the effective energy as an order parameter by the funneledness of the underlying protein free energy landscape. We also demonstrate that an improved conformational space discretization is achieved by incorporating the effective energy. The most distinctive feature of this thermodynamic order parameter is that it works in pointing to near-native folded structures even when the knowledge of the native structure is lacking, and the use of the effective energy will also find applications in combination with methods of protein structure prediction.},

There is strong evidence suggesting that structural changes occurring in large biomolecular systems at long time scale dynamics may be captured by models coarser than atomistic, although a suitable or optimal coarse-graining is a priori unknown. Here we propose a systematic approach to learning a coarse representation of a macromolecule from microscopic simulation data. In particular, the definition of effective coarse variables is achieved by partitioning the degrees of freedom both in the structural (physical) space and in the conformational space. The identification of groups of microscopic particles forming dynamical coherent states in different metastable states leads to a multiscale description of the system, in space and time. The application of this approach to the folding dynamics of two proteins provides a revised view of the classical idea of prestructured regions (foldons) that combine during a protein-folding process and suggests a hierarchical characterization of the assembly process of folded structures.},

	abstract = {Markov state models represent a popular means to interpret biomolecular processes in terms of memoryless transitions between metastable conformational states. To gain insight into the underlying mechanism, it is instructive to determine all relevant pathways between initial and final states of the process. Currently available methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and transition path theory, are convenient for identifying the most frequented pathways. They are less suited to account for the typically huge amount of pathways with low probability which, though, may dominate the cumulative flux of the reaction. On the basis of a systematic construction of all possible pathways, the here proposed method {MSMPathfinder} is able to characterize the multitude of unique pathways (say, up to 1010) in a complex system and to quantitatively calculate their correct weights and associated waiting times with predefined accuracy. Adopting the chiral transitions of a peptide helix and the folding of the villin headpiece as model problems, mechanisms and associated waiting times of these processes are discussed using a kinetic network representation. The analysis reveals that the waiting time distribution may yield only little insight into the diversity of pathways, because the measured folding times do typically not reflect the most probable path lengths but rather the cumulative effect of many different pathways.},

A deep continual learning algorithm, namely autonomous deep learning ({ADL}), is proposed in this paper. Unlike traditional deep learning methods, {ADL} features a flexible structure where its network structure can be constructed from scratch with the absence of initial network structure via the self-constructing network structure. {ADL} specifically addresses catastrophic forgetting by having a different-depth structure which is capable of achieving a trade-off between plasticity and stability. Network significance ({NS}) formula is proposed to drive the hidden nodes growing and pruning mechanism. Drift detection scenario ({DDS}) is put forward to signal distributional changes in data streams which induce the creation of a new hidden layer. Maximum information compression index ({MICI}) method plays an important role as a complexity reduction module eliminating redundant layers. The efficacy of {ADL} is numerically validated under the prequential test-then-train procedure in lifelong environments using nine popular data stream problems. The numerical results demonstrate that {ADL} consistently outperforms recent continual learning methods while characterizing the automatic construction of network structures.},

	shorttitle = {Pathway Histogram Analysis of Trajectories},
	abstract = {A key overall goal of biomolecular simulations is the characterization of "mechanism" -- the pathways through configuration space of processes such as conformational transitions and binding. Some amount of heterogeneity is intrinsic to the ensemble of pathways, in direct analogy to thermal configurational ensembles. Quantification of that heterogeneity is essential to a complete understanding of mechanism. We propose a general approach for characterizing path ensembles based on mapping individual trajectories into pathway classes whose populations and uncertainties can be analyzed as an ordinary histogram, providing a quantitative "fingerprint" of mechanism. In contrast to prior flux-based analyses used for discrete-state models, stochastic deviations from average behavior are explicitly included via direct classification of trajectories. The histogram approach, furthermore, is applicable to analysis of continuous trajectories. It enables straightforward comparison between ensembles produced by different methods or under different conditions. To implement the formulation, we develop approaches for classifying trajectories, including a clustering-based approach suitable for both continuous-space (e.g., molecular dynamics) or discrete-state (e.g., Markov state model) trajectories, as well as a "fundamental sequence" approach tailored for discrete-state trajectories but also applicable to continuous trajectories through a mapping process. We apply the pathway histogram analysis to a toy model and an extremely long atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory of protein folding.},

	shorttitle = {Online Learning},
	abstract = {Online learning represents a family of machine learning methods, where a learner attempts to tackle some predictive (or any type of decision-making) task by learning from a sequence of data instances one by one at each time. The goal of online learning is to maximize the accuracy/correctness for the sequence of predictions/decisions made by the online learner given the knowledge of correct answers to previous prediction/learning tasks and possibly additional information. This is in contrast to traditional batch or oﬄine machine learning methods that are often designed to learn a model from the entire training data set at once. Online learning has become a promising technique for learning from continuous streams of data in many real-world applications. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the online machine learning literature through a systematic review of basic ideas and key principles and a proper categorization of diﬀerent algorithms and techniques. Generally speaking, according to the types of learning tasks and the forms of feedback information, the existing online learning works can be classiﬁed into three major categories: (i) online supervised learning where full feedback information is always available, (ii) online learning with limited feedback, and (iii) online unsupervised learning where no feedback is available. Due to space limitation, the survey will be mainly focused on the ﬁrst category, but also brieﬂy cover some basics of the other two categories. Finally, we also discuss some open issues and attempt to shed light on potential future research directions in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Online learning is an important technical means for sketching massive real-time and high-speed data. Although this direction has attracted intensive attention, most of the literature in this area ignore the following three issues: (1) they think little of the underlying abstract hierarchical latent information existing in examples, even if extracting these abstract hierarchical latent representations is useful to better predict the class labels of examples; (2) the idea of preassigned model on unseen datapoints is not suitable for modeling streaming data with evolving probability distribution. This challenge is referred as “model flexibility”. And so, with this in minds, the online deep learning model we need to design should have a variable underlying structure; (3) moreover, it is of utmost importance to fusion these abstract hierarchical latent representations to achieve better classification performance, and we should give different weights to different levels of implicit representation information when dealing with the data streaming where the data distribution changes. To address these issues, we propose a two-phase Online Deep Learning based on Auto-Encoder ({ODLAE}). Based on auto-encoder, considering reconstruction loss, we extract abstract hierarchical latent representations of instances; Based on predictive loss, we devise two fusion strategies: the output-level fusion strategy, which is obtained by fusing the classification results of encoder’s each hidden layer; and feature-level fusion strategy, which is leveraged self-attention mechanism to fusion the every hidden layer’s output. Finally, in order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, we also try to utilize the denoising auto-encoder to yield hierarchical latent representations. Experimental results on different datasets are presented to verify the validity of our proposed algorithm ({ODLAE}) outperforms several baselines.},

The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

	abstract = {Elucidating physical mechanisms with statistical confidence from molecular dynamics simulations can be challenging owing to the many degrees of freedom that contribute to collective motions. To address this issue, we recently introduced a dynamical Galerkin approximation ({DGA}) [Thiede, E. H. J. Chem. Phys., 150, 2019, 244111], in which chemical kinetic statistics that satisfy equations of dynamical operators are represented by a basis expansion. Here, we reformulate this approach, clarifying (and reducing) the dependence on the choice of lag time. We present a new projection of the reactive current onto collective variables and provide improved estimators for rates and committors. We also present simple procedures for constructing suitable smoothly varying basis functions from arbitrary molecular features. To evaluate estimators and basis sets numerically, we generate and carefully validate a data set of short trajectories for the unfolding and folding of the trp-cage miniprotein, a well-studied system. Our analysis demonstrates a comprehensive strategy for characterizing reaction pathways quantitatively.},

While the binding pose is known from X-ray crystallography, the different steps leading to the formation of the complex are not well understood. The results from extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that imatinib can primarily exit the known crystallographic binding pose through the cleft of the binding site or by sliding under the αC helix. Once displaced from the crystallographic binding pose, imatinib becomes trapped in intermediate states. These intermediates are characterized by a high diversity of ligand orientations and conformations, and relaxation timescales within this region may exceed 3–4 ms. Analysis indicates that the metastable intermediate states should be spectroscopically indistinguishable from the crystallographic binding pose, in agreement with tryptophan stopped-flow fluorescence experiments.},

	abstract = {Recent learning-to-plan methods have shown promising results on planning directly from observation space. Yet, their ability to plan for long-horizon tasks is limited by the accuracy of the prediction model. On the other hand, classical symbolic planners show remarkable capabilities in solving long-horizon tasks, but they require predefined symbolic rules and symbolic states, restricting their real-world applicability. In this work, we combine the benefits of these two paradigms and propose a learning-to-plan method that can directly generate a long-term symbolic plan conditioned on high-dimensional observations. We borrow the idea of regression (backward) planning from classical planning literature and introduce Regression Planning Networks ({RPN}), a neural network architecture that plans backward starting at a task goal and generates a sequence of intermediate goals that reaches the current observation. We show that our model not only inherits many favorable traits from symbolic planning, e.g., the ability to solve previously unseen tasks but also can learn from visual inputs in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate the capabilities of {RPN} in a grid world environment and a simulated 3D kitchen environment featuring complex visual scenes and long task horizons, and show that it achieves near-optimal performance in completely new task instances.},

Incorporation of physical constraints such as time-reversibility or stochasticity into the dynamical model has been established for a linear, but not for arbitrarily nonlinear (deep learning) representations of the latent space. Here we develop theory and methods for deep learning Markov and Koopman models that can bear such physical constraints.  We prove that the model is an universal approximator for reversible Markov processes and that it can be optimized with either maximum likelihood or the variational approach of Markov processes ({VAMP}).  We demonstrate that the model performs equally well for equilibrium and systematically better for biased data compared to existing approaches, thus providing a tool to study the long-timescale processes of dynamical systems.},

Approaches based on the theory of stochastic processes can be particularly suitable for this purpose. Here, we develop a Markov state model and apply it to determine a kinetic ensemble of Aβ42, a disordered peptide associated with Alzheimer’s disease. Through the Google Compute Engine, we generated 315-µs all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories. Using a probabilistic-based definition of conformational states in a neural network approach, we found that Aβ42 is characterized by inter-state transitions on the microsecond timescale, exhibiting only fully unfolded or short-lived, partially folded states. Our results illustrate how kinetic ensembles provide effective information about the structure, thermodynamics and kinetics of disordered proteins.},

	url = {https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/15563},
	abstract = {For the last 50 years changes to the fluorescence properties of 2-aminopurine have been used to probe the structure and dynamics of {DNA}. 2-Aminopurine's utility has arisen from the quenching of its emission when pi-stacked with neighboring nucleobases. In the time-domain, the emission decay profile of 2-aminopurine requires multiple exponential decay components to model. Despite its extensive usage, the microscopic origin of the decay heterogeneity is not clear. In this thesis, steady-state absorption, fluorescence, and time-resolved fluorescence results are compared to multiple microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of 2-aminopurine-labeled adenine containing single-stranded {DNA} oligomers of varying length and position of the 2-aminopurine probe. First, previous reports of ultrafast electron transfer in pi-stacked adenine oligomers are used to build a new model for quenching of 2-aminopurine that is pi-stacked with adenine. For dinucleotides, a static distribution of unstacked structures combined with a distance dependent electron transfer mechanism is posited to explain the disperse emission decay timescales. Investigating the dinucleotides with molecular dynamics simulations analyzed with Markov state models quantify the structural heterogeneity of the dinucleotides. At least seven structures are sampled that could alter the quenching of 2-aminopurines's fluorescence. The Markov state models also demonstrate the timescales for transitions between these structures range from 1.6 to 25 ns, suggesting 2-aminopurine, with its monomer-like lifetime of 10 ns, is sensitive to the conformational dynamics of the dinucleotides as well. This dual fluorescence quenching and molecular dynamics simulation approach is extended to 2-aminopurine labeled trinucleotides and 15 base oligomers to interrogate the position dependent structural heterogeneity and conformational dynamics in these systems. Both shifts in the experimental absorption spectra, and molecular dynamics simulations agree that the interior base is more likely to be stacked than the exterior bases. Time-resolved emission experiments reveal emission from 2-aminopurine is quenched faster on the 5' end relative to the 3' end, in agreement with the faster stacking kinetics observed for bases on the 5' end relative to the 3' end obtained from molecular dynamics simulation. These results suggest that the time-resolved emission from 2-aminopurine may serve as an experimental observable for calibration of the dynamical properties predicted by molecular dynamics simulation.},

	title = {Adaptive sampling of Conformational Dynamics},
	url = {https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/108744},
	abstract = {At the core of our limited ability to understand many biophysical processes is the challenge of predicting the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. This challenge includes many open questions around the biophysical causes of many diseases or open questions in biophysics theory. Adaptive sampling is an approach to increase our ability to predict conformational dynamics. Adaptive sampling is a class of sampling strategies, where an ensemble of molecular dynamics trajectories is generated, where the starting points for the individual trajectories depend on the previously simulated trajectories. This approach will be investigated in this thesis. 

The application of adaptive sampling to biomolecules is one example of the more general problem of accurately sampling the time-dynamics of high-dimensional stochastic systems. The high-dimensionality, combined with a complex energy landscape, impede simpler approaches. Due to the broad scope of the general challenge, this Dissertation will focus only on improving the prediction of conformational dynamics for proteins. 

Many previous approaches to unravel this challenge have achieved significant improvements. In the case of proteins, the timescales where we can predict the conformational dynamics have increased by many orders of magnitudes to the millisecond scale. Despite the improvements, the current state-of-art can only predict the accurate behavior for small proteins. This illustrates the magnitude of the challenge. For most of the larger biomolecules, we are not able to simulate the precise behavior. This is not only caused by the several magnitudes longer timescales for these larger systems but also an order of magnitude larger sizes of these biomolecules.  

In this thesis, the adaptive sampling of conformational dynamics will be investigated in several steps. First, the prediction of the effectivity of different adaptive sampling strategies will be discussed. Due to significant stochasticity and protein-to-protein variation, the choice of adaptive sampling strategy is not apparent. The performance of different strategies for different goals varies as well. 

Second, to deepen our theoretical understanding of adaptive sampling strategies, an upper limit for the performance of any adaptive sampling strategy is developed. This theoretical upper limit allows us to understand the potential and limits of adaptive sampling.

Third, adaptive sampling is heavily dependent on software due to the necessary thousands or millions of individual steps. All these steps have to be executed efficiently on a High-Performance Computer ({HPC}). Here we show the development of the software package {ExTASY}. This framework allows performing all the necessary steps in adaptive sampling while reducing the workload. The innovations of {ExTASY} are both the high-scalability and the modularity. The modularity allows for an easy change of the adaptive sampling strategies and better maintainability. {ExTASY} is reducing the entry barrier to utilizing adaptive sampling.

Finally, the package {ExTASY} will be applied to show the results of adaptive sampling for several proteins. Future developments to extend the investigated approaches to longer timescales will be addressed.

All the approaches mentioned above facilitate further advancements in predicting conformational dynamics of larger biomolecules.},

The resulting fentanyl-bound pose provides rational insight into a wealth of historical structure-activity-relationship on its chemical scaffold. Following an in-silico derived hypothesis we found that fentanyl and the synthetic opioid peptide {DAMGO} require M153 to induce β-arrestin coupling, while M153 was dispensable for G protein coupling. We propose and validate an activation mechanism where the n-aniline ring of fentanyl mediates μ{OR} β-arrestin through a novel M153 “microswitch” by synthesizing fentanyl-based derivatives that exhibit complete, clinically desirable, G protein biased coupling. Together, these results provide molecular insight into fentanyl mediated β-arrestin biased signaling and a rational framework for further optimization of fentanyl-based analgesics with improved safety profiles.},

	abstract = {Time-lagged independent component analysis ({tICA}) is a widely used dimension reduction method for the analysis of molecular dynamics ({MD}) trajectories and has proven particularly useful for the construction of protein dynamics Markov models. It identifies those “slow” collective degrees of freedom onto which the projections of a given trajectory show maximal autocorrelation for a given lag time. Here we ask how much information on the actual protein dynamics and, in particular, the free energy landscape that governs these dynamics the {tICA}-projections of {MD}-trajectories contain, as opposed to noise due to the inherently stochastic nature of each trajectory. To answer this question, we have analyzed the {tICA}-projections of high dimensional random walks using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. We find that the projections resemble cosine functions and strongly depend on the lag time, exhibiting strikingly complex behavior. In particular, and contrary to previous studies of principal component projections, the projections change noncontinuously with increasing lag time. The {tICA}-projections of selected 1 μs protein trajectories and those of random walks are strikingly similar, particularly for larger proteins, suggesting that these trajectories contain only little information on the energy landscape that governs the actual protein dynamics. Further the {tICA}-projections of random walks show clusters very similar to those observed for the protein trajectories, suggesting that clusters in the {tICA}-projections of protein trajectories do not necessarily reflect local minima in the free energy landscape. We also conclude that, in addition to the previous finding that certain ensemble properties of nonconverged protein trajectories resemble those of random walks; this is also true for their time correlations.},

	abstract = {How do we find patterns in author-keyword associations, evolving over time? Or in Data Cubes, with product-branch-customer sales information? Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis ({PCA}) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks and many more. However, they have only two orders, like author and keyword, in the above example.We propose to envision such higher order data as tensors,and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce the dynamic tensor analysis ({DTA}) method, and its variants. {DTA} provides a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and it also reveals the hidden correlations. Algorithmically, we designed {DTA} very carefully so that it is (a) scalable, (b) space efficient (it does not need to store the past) and (c) fully automatic with no need for user defined parameters. Moreover, we propose {STA}, a streaming tensor analysis method, which provides a fast, streaming approximation to {DTA}.We implemented all our methods, and applied them in two real settings, namely, anomaly detection and multi-way latent semantic indexing. We used two real, large datasets, one on network flow data (100GB over 1 month) and one from {DBLP} (200MB over 25 years). Our experiments show that our methods are fast, accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

	title = {An Online Approach for Mining Collective Behaviors from Molecular Dynamics Simulations},
	abstract = {Collective behavior involving distally separate regions in a protein is known to widely affect its function. In this paper, we present an online approach to study and characterize collective behavior in proteins as molecular dynamics simulations progress. Our representation of {MD} simulations as a stream of continuously evolving data allows us to succinctly capture spatial and temporal dependencies that may exist and analyze them efﬁciently using data mining techniques. By using multi-way analysis we identify (a) parts of the protein that are dynamically coupled, (b) constrained residues/ hinge sites that may potentially affect protein function and (c) time-points during the simulation where signiﬁcant deviation in collective behavior occurred. We demonstrate the applicability of this method on two different protein simulations for barnase and cyclophilin A. For both these proteins we were able to identify constrained/ ﬂexible regions, showing good agreement with experimental results and prior computational work. Similarly, for the two simulations, we were able to identify time windows where there were signiﬁcant structural deviations. Of these time-windows, for both proteins, over 70\% show collective displacements in two or more functionally relevant regions. Taken together, our results indicate that multi-way analysis techniques can be used to analyze protein dynamics and may be an attractive means to automatically track and monitor molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {Large parallel machines generally offer the best parallel performance with "native execution" that is achieved using codes developed with the optimized compilers, communication libraries, and runtimes offered on the machines. In this paper, we report and analyze performance results from native execution of deep learning on a leadership-class high-performance computing ({HPC}) system. Using our new code called {DeepEx}, we present a study of the parallel speed up and convergence rates of learning achieved with native parallel execution. In the trade-off between computational parallelism and synchronized convergence, we first focus on maximizing parallelism while still obtaining convergence. Scaling results are reported from execution on up to 15,000 {GPUs} using two scientific data sets from atom microscopy and protein folding applications, and also using the popular {ImageNet} data set. In terms of the traditional measure of parallel speed up, excellent scaling is observed up to 12,000 {GPUs}. Additionally, accounting for convergence rates of deep learning accuracy or error, a deep learning-specific metric called "learning speed up" is also tracked. The performance results indicate the need to evaluate parallel deep learning execution in terms of learning speed up, and point to additional directions for improved exploitation of high-end {HPC} systems.},

It is therefore well-suited to analyzing long timescale simulations, which are critical for studying biologically relevant motions but may be too large for traditional analysis methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that the patterns discovered by {DTA} often correspond to functionally important conformational substates. In particular, we apply {DTA} to a 150 ns simulation of ubiquitin and discover patterns that provide unique insights into ubiquitin's ability to bind multiple substrates. Moreover, we take advantage of {DTA}'s ability to identify patterns on different timescales and investigate how fast positional fluctuations may modulate slower, large-scale motions in functionally important regions. Our findings here suggest that {DTA} is well-suited to organizing, visualizing, and analyzing very large trajectories and discovering conformational substates.},

Although the Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-{EM}) uncovered the static atomic details of {ACE}2 homodimers, there is still a lack of research on the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of these full-length structures. This information is helpful to understand and interpret the role of {ACE}2 in the cell entry of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. In order to obtain this information, we performed microsecond-scale conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations of full-length all-atomic systems of the {RBD}-{ACE}2 complex, the normal and torsional conformations of the apo-{ACE}2 homodimer. The comparative analysis of these systems showed that there were differences in their allosteric signal pathways and motion trends. These results may be helpful to further explore the cell entry mechanism of {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Moreover, the binding free energy and hydrogen bond distribution analysis of {RBD}-{ACE}2 binding interface provided the binding motifs that may be critical to allosteric signal transmission and {RBD} binding. These multi-conformational binding motifs can be used as targets or templates for the inhibitor design of the cell entry of {SARS}-{CoV}-2.},

Rather than using traditional atom typing, our approach is built on the {SMIRKS}-native Open Force Field ({SMIRNOFF}) parameter assignment formalism, which handles increases in the diversity and specificity of the force field definition without needlessly increasing the complexity of the specification. Parameters are optimized with the {ForceBalance} tool, based on reference quantum chemical data that include torsion potential energy profiles, optimized gas-phase structures, and vibrational frequencies. These quantum reference data are computed and are maintained with {QCArchive}, an open-source and freely available distributed computing and database software ecosystem. In this initial application of the method, we present essentially a full optimization of all valence parameters and report tests of the resulting force field against compounds and data types outside the training set. These tests show improvements in optimized geometries and conformational energetics and demonstrate that Parsley’s accuracy for liquid properties is similar to that of other general force fields, as is accuracy on binding free energies. We find that this initial Parsley force field affords accuracy similar to that of other general force fields when used to calculate relative binding free energies spanning 199 protein–ligand systems. Additionally, the resulting infrastructure allows us to rapidly optimize an entirely new force field with minimal human intervention.},

	abstract = {The development of enhanced sampling methods has greatly extended the scope of atomistic simulations, allowing long-time phenomena to be studied with accessible computational resources. Many such methods rely on the identification of an appropriate set of collective variables. These are meant to describe the system's modes that most slowly approach equilibrium. Once identified, the equilibration of these modes is accelerated by the enhanced sampling method of choice. An attractive way of determining the collective variables is to relate them to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the transfer operator. Unfortunately, this requires knowing the long-term dynamics of the system beforehand, which is generally not available. However, we have recently shown that it is indeed possible to determine efficient collective variables starting from biased simulations. In this paper, we bring the power of machine learning and the efficiency of the recently developed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling method to bear on this approach. The result is a powerful and robust algorithm that, given an initial enhanced sampling simulation performed with trial collective variables or generalized ensembles, extracts transfer operator eigenfunctions using a neural network ansatz and then accelerates them to promote sampling of rare events. To illustrate the generality of this approach we apply it to several systems, ranging from the conformational transition of a small molecule to the folding of a mini-protein and the study of materials crystallization.},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}) have been widely applied to study the kinetics and pathways of protein conformational dynamics based on statistical analysis of molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. These {MSMs} coarse-grain both conﬁguration space and time in ways that limit what kinds of observables they can reproduce with high ﬁdelity over diﬀerent spatial and temporal resolutions. Despite their popularity, there is still limited understanding of which biophysical observables can be computed from these {MSMs} in a robust and unbiased manner, and which suﬀer from the space-time coarse-graining intrinsic in the {MSM} model. Most theoretical arguments and practical validity tests for {MSMs} rely on long-time equilibrium kinetics, such as the slowest relaxation time scales and experimentally observable time-correlation functions. Here, we perform an extensive assessment of the ability of well-validated protein folding {MSMs} to accurately reproduce path-based observable such as mean ﬁrst-passage times ({MFPTs}) and transition path mechanisms compared to a direct trajectory analysis. We also assess a recently proposed class of history-augmented {MSMs} ({haMSMs}) that exploit additional information not accounted for in standard {MSMs}. We conclude with some practical guidance on the use of {MSMs} to study various problems in conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In brief, {MSMs} can accurately reproduce correlation functions slower than the lag time, but path-based observables can only be reliably reproduced if the lifetimes of states exceed the lag time, which is a much stricter requirement. Even in the presence of short-lived states, we ﬁnd that {haMSMs} reproduce path-based observables more reliably.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations must take very small (femtosecond) integration steps in simulation-time to avoid numerical errors. Efficient use of parallel programming models and accelerators in state-of-the art {MD} programs now is pushing Moore’s limit for time-per-{MD} step. As a result, directly simulating timescales beyond milliseconds will not be attainable directly, even at exascale. However, concepts from statistical physics can be used to combine many parallel simulations to provide information about longer timescales and to adequately sample the simulation space, while preserving details about the dynamics of the system. Implementing such an approach requires a workflow program that allows adaptable steering of task assignments based on extensive statistical analysis of intermediate results. Here we report the implementation of such an adaptable workflow program to drive simulations on the Summit {IBM} Power System {AC}922, a pre-exascale supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility ({OLCF}). We compare to experiences on Titan, Summit’s predecessor, report the performance of the workflow and its components, and describe the porting process. We find that using a workflow program managed by a Mongo database can provide the fault tolerance, scalable performance, task dispatch rate, and reconfigurability required for robust and portable implementation of ensemble simulations such as are used in enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics. This type of workflow generator can also be used to provide adaptive steering of ensemble simulations for other applications in addition to {MD}.},

In this paper, we introduce an approximation to the prior/posterior distribution of the parameters in the beta distribution and propose an analytically tractable (closed form) Bayesian approach to the parameter estimation. The approach is based on the variational inference ({VI}) framework. Following the principles of the {VI} framework and utilizing the relative convexity bound, the extended factorized approximation method is applied to approximate the distribution of the parameters in {BMM}. In a fully Bayesian model where all of the parameters of the {BMM} are considered as variables and assigned proper distributions, our approach can asymptotically find the optimal estimate of the parameters posterior distribution. Also, the model complexity can be determined based on the data. The closed-form solution is proposed so that no iterative numerical calculation is required. Meanwhile, our approach avoids the drawback of overfitting in the conventional expectation maximization algorithm. The good performance of this approach is verified by experiments with both synthetic and real data.},

	abstract = {Enzymes catalyze a particular reaction in cells, but only a few control the rate of this reaction and the metabolic pathway that follows. One specific mechanism for such enzymatic control of a metabolic pathway involves molecular feedback, whereby a metabolite further down the pathway acts at a unique site on the control enzyme to alter its activity allosterically. This regulation may be positive or negative (or both), depending upon the particular system. Another method of enzymatic control involves the cooperative binding of the substrate, which allows a large change in enzyme activity to emanate from only a small change in substrate concentration. Allosteric regulation and homotropic cooperativity are often known to involve significant conformational changes in the structure of the protein.Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase ({ATCase}) is the textbook example of an enzyme that regulates a metabolic pathway, namely, pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, by feedback control and by the cooperative binding of the substrate, l-aspartate. The catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of this enzyme have been extensively studied. A series of X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme in the presence and absence of substrates, products, and analogues have provided details, at the molecular level, of the conformational changes that the enzyme undergoes as it shifts between its low-activity, low-affinity form (T state) to its high-activity, high-affinity form (R state). These structural data provide insights into not only how this enzyme catalyzes the reaction between l-aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate and inorganic phosphate, but also how the allosteric effectors modulate this activity.In this Account, we summarize studies on the structure of the enzyme and describe how these structural data provide insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. The {ATCase}-catalyzed reaction is regulated by nucleotide binding some 60 Å from the active site, inducing structural alterations that modulate catalytic activity. The delineation of the structure and function in this particular model system will help in understanding the molecular basis of cooperativity and allosteric regulation in other systems as well.},

We present kinetic data and five X-ray structures determined in the absence and presence of a Mg2+ concentration within the physiological range. In the presence of 2 {mM} divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+), {CTP} does not significantly inhibit the enzyme, while the allosteric activation by {ATP} is enhanced. The data suggest that the actual allosteric inhibitor of {ATCase} in vivo is the combination of {CTP}, {UTP}, and a divalent cation, and the actual allosteric activator is a divalent cation with {ATP} or {ATP} and {GTP}. The structural data reveals that two {NTPs} can bind to each allosteric site with a divalent cation acting as a bridge between the triphosphates. Thus, the regulation of {ATCase} is far more complex than previously believed and calls many previous studies into question. The X-ray structures reveal that the catalytic chains undergo essentially no alternations; however, several regions of the regulatory chains undergo significant structural changes. Most significant is that the N-terminal region of the regulatory chains exists in different conformations in the allosterically activated and inhibited forms of the enzyme. Here, a new model of allosteric regulation is proposed.},

We describe the evolution of the allostery concept, from a conformational change in a two-state model (1965, 1966) to dynamic allostery in the ensemble model (1999); from multi-subunit (1965) proteins to all proteins (2004).

	url = {https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/247281},
	abstract = {This thesis develops a method for automatically constructing, visualizing and describing 
a large class of models, useful for forecasting and finding structure in domains such 
as time series, geological formations, and physical dynamics. These models, based on 
Gaussian processes, can capture many types of statistical structure, such as periodicity, 
changepoints, additivity, and symmetries. Such structure can be encoded through kernels, 
which have historically been hand-chosen by experts. We show how to automate 
this task, creating a system that explores an open-ended space of models and reports 
the structures discovered. 
 
To automatically construct Gaussian process models, we search over sums and products 
of kernels, maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood. We show how any 
model in this class can be automatically decomposed into qualitatively different parts, 
and how each component can be visualized and described through text. We combine 
these results into a procedure that, given a dataset, automatically constructs a model 
along with a detailed report containing plots and generated text that illustrate the 
structure discovered in the data. 
 
The introductory chapters contain a tutorial showing how to express many types of 
structure through kernels, and how adding and multiplying different kernels combines 
their properties. Examples also show how symmetric kernels can produce priors over 
topological manifolds such as cylinders, toruses, and Möbius strips, as well as their 
higher-dimensional generalizations. 
 
This thesis also explores several extensions to Gaussian process models. First, building 
on existing work that relates Gaussian processes and neural nets, we analyze natural 
extensions of these models to deep kernels and deep Gaussian processes. Second, we examine 
additive Gaussian processes, showing their relation to the regularization method 
of dropout. Third, we combine Gaussian processes with the Dirichlet process to produce 
the warped mixture model: a Bayesian clustering model having nonparametric cluster 
shapes, and a corresponding latent space in which each cluster has an interpretable 
parametric form.},

The direct computation of the infinitesimal generator is not easy because of the discretization of the state space, in particular because of the trade-off inherent in the choice of the best lag time to study the process. Short lag times implies a strong discretization of the state space and a consequent loss of Markovianity. Large lag times bypass events on fast timescales. We propose a method to approximate the generator with the computation of the Newton polynomial extrapolation. This technique is a multistep approach which uses as its input Koopman transfer operators evaluated for a series of lag times. Thus, the estimated infinitesimal generator combines information from different time resolutions and does not bias only fast- or slow-decaying dynamics. We show that the multi-scale Newton method can improve the estimation of the generator in comparison to the computation using finite difference or matrix logarithm methods.},

We prove a new relative error bound in terms of the eigenfunction approximation error for reversible systems. We also present numerical examples indicating that, if Kramers–Moyal ({KM}) type approximations are used to compute the spectrum of the reduced generator, it seems largely insensitive to the time window used for the {KM} estimators.

	abstract = {Extracting insight from the enormous quantity of data generated from molecular simulations requires the identification of a small number of collective variables whose corresponding low-dimensional free-energy landscape retains the essential features of the underlying system. Data-driven techniques provide a systematic route to constructing this landscape, without the need for extensive a priori intuition into the relevant driving forces. In particular, autoencoders are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, as they naturally force an information bottleneck and, thereby, a low-dimensional embedding of the essential features. While variational autoencoders ensure continuity of the embedding by assuming a unimodal Gaussian prior, this is at odds with the multi-basin free-energy landscapes that typically arise from the identification of meaningful collective variables. In this work, we incorporate this physical intuition into the prior by employing a Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder ({GMVAE}), which encourages the separation of metastable states within the embedding. The {GMVAE} performs dimensionality reduction and clustering within a single unified framework, and is capable of identifying the inherent dimensionality of the input data, in terms of the number of Gaussians required to categorize the data. We illustrate our approach on two toy models, alanine dipeptide, and a challenging disordered peptide ensemble, demonstrating the enhanced clustering effect of the {GMVAE} prior compared to standard {VAEs}. The resulting embeddings appear to be promising representations for constructing Markov state models, highlighting the transferability of the dimensionality reduction from static equilibrium properties to dynamics.},

We present an efficient implementation of symplectic neural coordinate transformations and two ways to train the model based either on the Hamiltonian function or phase-space samples. The learned model maps physical variables onto an independent representation where collective modes with different frequencies are separated, which can be useful for various downstream tasks such as compression, prediction, control, and sampling. We demonstrate the ability of this method first by analyzing toy problems and then by applying it to real-world problems, such as identifying and interpolating slow collective modes of the alanine dipeptide molecule and {MNIST} database images.},

In this paper, we reformulate coarse-graining as a supervised machine learning problem. We use statistical learning theory to decompose the coarse-graining error and cross-validation to select and compare the performance of different models. We introduce {CGnets}, a deep learning approach, that learns coarse-grained free energy functions and can be trained by a force-matching scheme. {CGnets} maintain all physically relevant invariances and allow one to incorporate prior physics knowledge to avoid sampling of unphysical structures. We show that {CGnets} can capture all-atom explicit-solvent free energy surfaces with models using only a few coarse-grained beads and no solvent, while classical coarse-graining methods fail to capture crucial features of the free energy surface. Thus, {CGnets} are able to capture multibody terms that emerge from the dimensionality reduction.},

In this study, we focus on data-driven methods to preserve the rare-event kinetics of the original system and make use of their close connection to the low-lying spectrum of the system’s generator. Building on work by Crommelin and Vanden-Eijnden [Multiscale Model.

The cost of simulating many-body atomic systems makes simulations of large molecules prohibitively expensive, and the high-dimensionality of the resulting trajectories presents a challenge for analysis. Driven by advances in algorithms, hardware, and data availability, there has been a flare of interest in recent years in the applications of machine learning – especially deep learning – to molecular simulation. These techniques have demonstrated great power and flexibility in both extracting mechanistic understanding of the important nonlinear collective variables governing the dynamics of a molecular system, and in furnishing good low-dimensional system representations with which to perform enhanced sampling or develop long-timescale dynamical models.

	abstract = {Nanosecond laser temperature jumps with tryptophan fluorescence detection and molecular dynamics simulation with kinetic dimensionality reduction were used to study the helix–coil transition in a 21-residue α-helical heteropeptide. Analysis of the temperature- dependent relaxation dynamics of this heteropeptide identified a distinct faster component of 20–35 ns, besides a slower component of 300–400 ns at temperatures between 296 and 280 K. To understand the mechanism of progression from a non-structured coil state to a structured helical state, we carried out a 12 μs molecular dynamics simulation of this peptide system. Clustering and optimal dimensionality reduction were applied to the molecular dynamics trajectory to generate low-dimensional coarse-grained models of the underlying kinetic network in terms of 2–5 metastable states. In accord with the generally accepted understanding of the multiple conformations and high entropy of the unfolded ensemble of states, the “coil” metastable set contains the largest number of structures. Interestingly, the helix metastable state was also found to be structurally heterogeneous, consisting of the completely helical form and several partly folded conformers that interconvert at a time scale faster that global folding. The intermediate states contain the fewest structures, have lowest populations, and have the shortest lifetimes. As the number of considered metastable states increases, more intermediates and more folding paths appear in the coarse-grained models. One of these intermediates corresponds to the transition state for folding, which involves an “off-center” helical region over residues 11–16. The kinetic network model is consistent with a statistical picture of folding following a simple reaction coordinate counting the helical population of individual residues. On the basis of simulations, we propose that the fast relaxation time should be assigned to cooperative folding/unfolding of segments of 1–4 neighboring residues.},

	abstract = {We develop a systematic procedure for obtaining rate and transition matrices that optimally describe the dynamics of aggregated superstates formed by combining (clustering or lumping) microstates. These reduced dynamical models are constructed by matching the time-dependent occupancy-number correlation functions of the superstates in the full and aggregated systems. Identical results are obtained by using a projection operator formalism. The reduced dynamic models are exact for all times in their full non-Markovian formulation. In the approximate Markovian limit, we derive simple analytic expressions for the reduced rate or Markov transition matrices that lead to exact auto- and cross-relaxation times. These reduced Markovian models strike an optimal balance between matching the dynamics at short and long times. We also discuss how this approach can be used in a hierarchical procedure of constructing optimal superstates through aggregation of microstates. The results of the general reduced-matrix theory are illustrated with applications to simple model systems and a more complex master-equation model of peptide folding derived previously from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We ﬁnd that the reduced models faithfully capture the dynamics of the full systems, producing substantial improvements over the common local-equilibrium approximation.},

	abstract = {Proteins implement their functionalities when folded into specific three-dimensional structures, and their functions are related to the protein structures and dynamics. Previously, we applied a relaxation mode analysis ({RMA}) method to protein systems; this method approximately estimates the slow relaxation modes and times via simulation and enables investigation of the dynamic properties underlying the protein structural fluctuations. Recently, two-step {RMA} with multiple evolution times has been proposed and applied to a slightly complex homopolymer system, i.e., a single [n]polycatenane. This method can be applied to more complex heteropolymer systems, i.e., protein systems, to estimate the relaxation modes and times more accurately. In two-step {RMA}, we first perform {RMA} and obtain rough estimates of the relaxation modes and times. Then, we apply {RMA} with multiple evolution times to a small number of the slowest relaxation modes obtained in the previous calculation. Herein, we apply this method to the results of principal component analysis ({PCA}). First, {PCA} is applied to a 2-μs molecular dynamics simulation of hen egg-white lysozyme in aqueous solution. Then, the two-step {RMA} method with multiple evolution times is applied to the obtained principal components. The slow relaxation modes and corresponding relaxation times for the principal components are much improved by the second {RMA}.},

Here, by performing molecular simulations of the whole enzymatic cycle for a model multisubstrate enzyme with a dynamic energy landscape model, we show that multisubstrate enzymes can utilize steric frustration to facilitate the rate-limiting product-release step. During the enzymatic cycles, the bottleneck product is actively squeezed out by the binding of a new substrate at the neighboring site through the population of a substrate-product cobound complex, in which the binding pockets are frustrated due to steric incompatibility. Such steric frustration thereby enables an active mechanism of product release driven by substrate-binding energy, facilitating the enzymatic cycle.},

The approach is based on the recently proposed most probable path algorithm which identifies the metastable states of the system, combined with dynamical coring of these states in order to obtain a consistent Markov state model. The method facilitates the construction of a dendrogram associated with the folding free-energy landscape of {HP}35, which reveals a hierarchical funnel structure and shows that the native state is rather a kinetic trap than a network hub. The energy landscape of {HP}35 consists of the entropic unfolded basin U, where the prestructuring of the protein takes place, the intermediate basin I, which is connected to U via the rate-limiting U → I transition state reflecting the formation of helix-1, and the native basin N, containing a state close to the {NMR} structure and a native-like state that exhibits enhanced fluctuations of helix-3. The model is in line with recent experimental observations that the intermediate and native states differ mostly in their dynamics (locked vs unlocked states). Employing dihedral angle principal component analysis, subdiffusive motion on a multidimensional free-energy surface is found.},

The N-terminal lid region of {MDM}2 modulates interactions with p53 via competition for its binding cleft, exchanging slowly between docked and undocked conformations in the absence of p53. To better understand these dynamics, we constructed Markov State Models ({MSMs}) from large collections of unbiased simulation trajectories of apo-{MDM}2, and find strong evidence for diffuse, yet two-state folding and binding of the N-terminal region to the p53 receptor site. The {MSM} also identifies holo-like receptor conformations highly suitable for computational docking, despite initiating trajectories from closed-cleft receptor structures unsuitable for docking. Fixed-anchor docking studies using a test set of high-affinity small molecules and peptides show simulated receptor ensembles achieve docking successes comparable to cross-docking studies using crystal structures of receptors bound by alternative ligands. For p53, the best-scoring receptor structures have the N-terminal region lid region bound in a helical conformation mimicking the bound structure of p53, suggesting lid region association induces receptor conformations suitable for binding. These results suggest that {MD} + {MSM} approaches can sample binding-competent receptor conformations suitable for computational peptidomimetic design, and that inclusion of disordered regions may be essential to capturing the correct receptor dynamics.},

However, the mechanistic basis of its ability to bind diverse signalling molecules including G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels and kinases remains poorly understood. Here we harness the high resolution of molecular dynamics simulations and the analytical power of Markov state models to dissect the molecular underpinnings of {CaM} binding diversity. Our computational model indicates that in the absence of Ca2+, sub-states in the folded ensemble of {CaM}’s C-terminal domain present chemically and sterically distinct topologies that may facilitate conformational selection. Furthermore, we find that local unfolding is off-pathway for the exchange process relevant for peptide binding, in contrast to prior hypotheses that unfolding might account for binding diversity. Finally, our model predicts a novel binding interface that is well-populated in the Ca2+-bound regime and, thus, a candidate for pharmacological intervention.},

We used different {AMBER} {DNA} force-field variants and also processed simulations by Markov State Model ({MSM}) analysis. The slow conformational transitions in the propeller loops took place on a scale of a few μs, emphasizing the need for long simulations in studies of {GQ} dynamics. The propeller loops sampled similar ensembles for all {GQ} topologies and for all force-field dihedral-potential variants. The outcomes of standard and {RECT} simulations were consistent and captured similar spectrum of loop conformations. However, the most common crystallographic loop conformation was very unstable with all force-field versions. Although the loss of canonical γ-trans state of the first propeller loop nucleotide could be related to the indispensable bsc0 α/γ dihedral potential, even supporting this particular dihedral by a bias was insufficient to populate the experimentally dominant loop conformation. In conclusion, while our simulations were capable of providing a reasonable albeit not converged sampling of the {TTA} propeller loop conformational space, the force-field description still remained far from satisfactory.},

More specifically, we observe two major peptide exchange pathways: the kinetic stability of a {pMHCII}’s ground state defines its propensity for intrinsic peptide exchange, while the population of a rare, intermediate conformation correlates with the propensity of the {HLA}-{DM}-catalysed pathway. Helix-destabilizing mutants designed based on our model shift the exchange behaviour towards the {HLA}-{DM}-catalysed pathway and further allow us to conceptualize how allelic variation can shape an individual’s {MHC} restricted immune response.},

The Dust Outflow and Deposition to the Ocean project ({DODO}) aimed to characterize the physical and optical properties of airborne North African dust in two seasons and to use these observations to constrain model simulations, with the ultimate aim of being able to quantify the deposition of iron to the North Atlantic Ocean. The in situ properties of dust from airborne campaigns measured during February and August 2006, based at Dakar, Senegal, are presented here. Average values of the single scattering albedo (0.99, 0.98), mass specific extinction (0.85 m2 g−1, 1.14 m2 g−1), asymmetry parameter (0.68, 0.68), and refractive index (1.53–0.0005i, 1.53–0.0014i) for the accumulation mode were found to differ by varying degrees between the dry and wet season, respectively. It is hypothesized that these differences are due to different source regions and transport processes which also differ between the {DODO} campaigns. Elemental ratios of Ca/Al were found to differ between the dry and wet season (1.1 and 0.5, respectively). Differences in vertical profiles are found between seasons and between land and ocean locations and reflect the different dynamics of the seasons. Using measurements of the coarse mode size distribution and illustrative Mie calculations, the optical properties are found to be very sensitive to the presence and amount of coarse mode of mineral dust, and the importance of accurate measurements of the coarse mode of dust is highlighted.},

Thus, although {SG} might reduce globally aggregated risks, it may increase climate risks for some regions8–10. Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution ({HiFLOR}) model—which resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremes11,12—alongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project ({GeoMIP}), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by {SG}. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that {SG} is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling {CO}2 (half-{SG}). In {HiFLOR}, half-{SG} offsets most of the {CO}2-induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-{SG} when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) Special Report on Extremes ({SREX}) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4\% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation.

A topic of significant discussion in the literature of the past 5–10 years has been the importance of protein dynamics in this process. This Feature Article will discuss the authors’ work on this still controversial topic with focus on both methodology and application to real systems. The end conclusion of this work has been that for specific enzymes under study protein dynamics on both rapid time scales of barrier crossing (termed promoting vibrations by the authors) and of conformational fluctuations are central to the function of biological catalysts. In another enzyme we will discuss, the results are far less clear. The manner of the coupling of chemistry to protein dynamics has deep implications for protein architecture, both natural and created, and recent results reinforce the complexity of the protein form that has evolved to support these functions.},

Previous studies showed that this reaction is nearly or fully rate limited by the hydrogen-transfer step. Semiclassical mass considerations that do not include tunneling effects would predict that {kH}/{kT} = ({kD}/{kT})3.26, where {kH}, {kD}, and {kT} are the rate constants for the reaction of protium, deuterium, and tritium derivatives, respectively. Significant deviations from this relation have now been observed for both primary and especially secondary effects, such that experimental H/T ratios are much greater than those calculated from the above expression. These deviations also hold in the temperature range from 0 to 40 degrees Celsius. Such deviations were previously predicted to result from a reaction coordinate containing a significant contribution from hydrogen tunneling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The mechanisms by which enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration and specificity have long been of key interest in biochemistry. It is generally recognized that substrate binding coupled to conformational changes of the substrate–enzyme complex aligns the reactive groups in an optimal environment for efficient chemistry. Although chemical mechanisms have been elucidated for many enzymes, the question of how enzymes achieve the catalytically competent state has only recently become approachable by experiment and computation. Here we show crystallographic evidence for conformational substates along the trajectory towards the catalytically competent ‘closed’ state in the ligand-free form of the enzyme adenylate kinase. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these partially closed conformations are sampled in nanoseconds, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling of a fully closed conformation occurring on the microsecond-to-millisecond timescale. Thus, the larger-scale motions in substrate-free adenylate kinase are not random, but preferentially follow the pathways that create the configuration capable of proficient chemistry. Such preferred directionality, encoded in the fold, may contribute to catalysis in many enzymes.},

	abstract = {The generalized Langevin equation ({GLE})-based Grote−Hynes ({GH}) theory is used to calculate the transmission coefficients, κ, for the methyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine to catecholate both in aqueous solution and in the catechol O-methyltransferase active site. Values of κ, which measures the deviation of the rate constants from the Transition State Theory ({TST}) predictions, are obtained by means of rare event molecular dynamics simulations. The results are 0.62 ± 0.04 and 0.83 ± 0.03 for the aqueous and enzymatic environments, respectively, while the Grote−Hynes predictions are 0.58 ± 0.09 and 0.89 ± 0.03, respectively. The Kramers theory estimates are much smaller, about 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. Thus, the enzymatic transmission coefficient is closer to {TST} predictions than the value obtained in solution. In addition, our results show that the enzymatic coefficient is also closer to its nonadiabatic (or frozen environment) limit than is the solution coefficient. These findings can be understood considering that, during the passage over the barrier top, there is a smaller coupling between the reactive system and the environment in the enzyme than in solution, as well as a smaller reorganization suffered by the enzyme. Analysis of the transition state friction kernel leads to the identification of some key vibrational modes governing the coupling between the two different environments and the reacting solute in the transition state region and insights on their relevance for the reaction dynamics' influence on the transmission coefficient.},

Here, we illustrate this concept by considering the {SN}2 reaction of haloalkan dehalogenase ({DhlA}), analyze the energetics and dynamics of the solvent coordinate, and evaluate their relative catalytic effect. It is demonstrated that almost the entire catalytic effect is associated with the preorganization of the protein−solvent coordinate. It is clarified that this effect is associated with the fact that the transition state is “solvated” by the protein more than in the reference solution reaction. This effect is fundamentally different than the frequently proposed desolvation mechanism. The possible catalytic role of dynamical effects is analyzed by considering several reasonable ways of defining “dynamical contributions to catalysis”. It is found that these contributions are small regardless of the definition used. It is also shown that the effect of the difference in the relaxation time of the solvent coordinate in the enzyme and solution reaction is rather trivial relative to the effect of the corresponding changes in reorganization free energy.},

Electrons are transferred from the tryptophan tryptophylquinone ({TTQ}) cofactor of {AADH} to the type I copper of the cupredoxin azurin. This structure is compared with the complex of the {TTQ}-containing methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}) and the cupredoxin amicyanin. Despite significant similarities between the two quinoproteins and the two cupredoxins, each is specific for its respective partner and the ionic strength dependence and magnitude of the binding constant for each complex are quite different. The {AADH}−azurin interface is largely hydrophobic, covering ∼500 Å2 of surface on each molecule, with one direct hydrogen bond linking them. The closest distance from {TTQ} to copper is 12.6 Å compared with a distance of 9.3 Å in the {MADH}−amicyanin complex. When the {MADH}−amicyanin complex is aligned with the {AADH}−azurin complex, the amicyanin lies on top of the azurin but is oriented quite differently. Although the copper atoms differ in position by ∼4.7 Å, the amicyanin bound to {MADH} appears to be rotated ∼90° from its aligned position with azurin. Comparison of the structures of the two complexes identifies features of the interface that dictate the specificity of the protein−protein interaction and determine the rate of interprotein electron transfer.},

These data are consistent with the Ping Pong kinetic mechanism and aminotransferase-type chemical reaction mechanism which have been previously proposed for {AADH}. Comparison of the 15N-{NMR} spectra of the aminoquinol {TTQ} intermediates of {AADH} and methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}) revealed that the substrate-derived aminoquinol N of {AADH} and {MADH} exhibited distinct 15N chemical shifts which are separated by approx. 7 p.p.m. In each case, the signal for the substrate-derived aminoquinol N appears optimally with short pulse delay and exhibits a relaxation time and chemical shift which are consistent with 15N covalently bound to an aromatic ring (i.e. aminoquinol) which is attached to a rigid protein matrix. The aminoquinol of {AADH} is less stable against reoxidation than that of {MADH}. These data suggest that differences in the active-site mediated electrostatic environments of the aminoquinol N in the respective enzymes may influence both the observed 15N chemical shift and the relative reactivities of the {TTQ} aminoquinols towards oxygen. These data also demonstrate the utility of 13C- and 15N-{NMR} spectroscopy as a tool for monitoring the intermediates and products of enzyme-catalysed transformations.},

Transient kinetic studies involving rapid mixing of {AADH} with cations and {pH} jump revealed that the rate of the cation-induced spectral changes initially decreased with increasing cation concentration to a minimum value, then increased with increasing cation concentration. A kinetic model was developed to fit these data, determine the true {pH}-independent Kd values for K+ and Na+, and explain the {pH}-dependence of the apparent Kd. A chemical reaction mechanism, based on the kinetic data, is presented in which the metallic univalent cation facilitates the chemical modification of the {TTQ} prosthetic group to form an hydroxide adduct which gives rise to the spectral change. Addition of {NH}4+/{NH}3 to {AADH} caused changes in the absorption spectrum which were very different form those caused by addition of the metallic univalent cations. The kinetics of the reaction induced by addition of {NH}4+/{NH}3 were also different, being simple saturation kinetics. Another reaction mechanism is proposed for the {NH}4+/{NH}3-induced spectral change that involves nucleophilic addition of the unprotonated {NH}3 to {TTQ}. The general relevance of these data and models to the physiological reactions of {TTQ}-dependent enzymes and to the roles of univalent cations in modulating enzyme activity are discussed.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Interprotein electron transfer ({ET}) occurs between the tryptophan tryptophylquinone ({TTQ}) prosthetic group of aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}) and copper of azurin. The {ET} reactions from two chemically distinct reduced forms of {TTQ} were studied: an \textit{O}-quinol form that was generated by reduction by dithionite, and an \textit{N}-quinol form that was generated by reduction by substrate. It was previously shown that on reduction by substrate, an amino group displaces a carbonyl oxygen on {TTQ}, and that this significantly alters the rate of its oxidation by azurin (Hyun, Y-L., and Davidson V. L. (1995) \textit{Biochemistry} 34, 12249–12254). To determine the basis for this change in reactivity, comparative kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of the {ET} reactions from the \textit{O}-quinol and \textit{N}-quinol forms of {TTQ} in {AADH} to the copper of azurin were performed. The reaction of the\textit{O}-quinol exhibited values of electronic coupling (\textit{H} $_{\textrm{{AB}}}$) of 0.13 cm$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and reorganizational energy (λ) of 1.6 {eV}, and predicted an {ET} distance of approximately 15 Å. These results are consistent with the {ET} event being the rate-determining step for the redox reaction. Analysis of the reaction of the \textit{N}-quinol by Marcus theory yielded an\textit{H} $_{\textrm{{AB}}}$ which exceeded the nonadiabatic limit and predicted a negative {ET} distance. These results are diagnostic of a gated {ET} reaction. Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 1.5 and 3.2 were obtained, respectively, for the {ET} reactions from\textit{O}-quinol and \textit{N}-quinol {AADH} indicating that transfer of an exchangeable proton was involved in the rate-limiting reaction step which gates {ET} from the \textit{N}-quinol, but not the\textit{O}-quinol. These results are compared with those for the {ET} reactions from another {TTQ} enzyme, methylamine dehydrogenase, to amicyanin. The mechanism by which the {ET} reaction of the\textit{N}-quinol is gated is also related to mechanisms of other gated interprotein {ET} reactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Structure−activity correlations have been employed previously in the mechanistic interpretation of {TTQ}-dependent amine dehydrogenases using a series of para-substituted benzylamines. However, by combining the use of kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}) and crystallographic analysis, in conjunction with structure−reactivity correlation studies, we show that para-substituted benzylamines are poor reactivity probes for {TTQ}-dependent aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}). Stopped-flow kinetic studies of the reductive half-reaction, with para-substituted benzylamines and their dideuterated counterparts, demonstrate that C−H or C−D bond breakage is not fully rate limiting ({KIEs} ∼ unity). Contrary to previous reports, Hammett plots exhibit a poor correlation of structure−reactivity data with electronic substituent effects for para-substituted benzylamines and phenylethylamines. Crystallographic studies of enzyme−substrate complexes reveal that the observed structure−reactivity correlations are not attributed to distinct binding modes for para-substituted benzylamines in the active site, although two binding sites for p-nitrobenzylamine are identified. We identify structural rearrangements, prior to the H-transfer step, which are likely to limit the rate of {TTQ} reduction by benzylamines. This work emphasizes (i) the need for caution when applying structure−activity correlations to enzyme-catalyzed reactions and (ii) the added benefit of using both isotope effects and structural analysis, in conjunction with structure−reactivity relationships, to study chemical steps in enzyme reaction cycles.},

Recent crystal structures have provided insight into the reductive half-reaction. In contrast, no atomic details are available for the oxidative half-reaction. The {TTQ} O7 hydroxyl group is protonated during reduction, but it is unclear how this proton can be removed during the oxidative half-reaction. Furthermore, compared with the electron transfer from the \textit{N}-quinol form, electron transfer from the non-physiological \textit{O}-quinol form to azurin is significantly slower. Here we report crystal structures of the \textit{O}-quinol, \textit{N}-quinol, and \textit{N}-semiquinone forms of {AADH}. A comparison of oxidized and substrate reduced {AADH} species reveals changes in the {TTQ}-containing subunit, extending from residues in the immediate vicinity of the \textit{N}-quinol to the putative azurin docking site, suggesting a mechanism whereby {TTQ} redox state influences interprotein electron transfer. In contrast, chemical reduction of the {TTQ} center has no significant effect on protein conformation. Furthermore, structural reorganization upon substrate reduction places a water molecule near {TTQ} O7 where it can act as proton acceptor. The structure of the \textit{N}-semiquinone, however, is essentially similar to oxidized {AADH}. Surprisingly, in the presence of substrate a covalent \textit{N}-semiquinone substrate adduct is observed. To our knowledge this is the first detailed insight into a complex, branching mechanism of quinone oxidation where significant structural reorganization upon reduction of the quinone center directly influences formation of the electron transfer complex and nature of the electron transfer process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The theory requires that there is strong coupling of the proton transfer solute to the surrounding polar solvent and includes the influence of the vibrational motion of the heavy particles between which the proton transfers.

Theoretically speaking, joint probabilities of the equilibrium distribution contain all thermodynamic information, but they prove increasingly difficult to compute and interpret as the dimensionality increases. Here, inspired by tools in probabilistic graphical modeling, we develop a factor graph trained through belief propagation that helps factorize the joint probability into an approximate tractable form that can be easily visualized and used. We validate the study through the analysis of the conformational dynamics of two small peptides with 5 and 9 residues. Our validations include testing the conditional dependency predictions through an intervention scheme inspired by Judea Pearl. Secondly we directly use the belief propagation based approximate probability distribution as a high-dimensional static bias for enhanced sampling, where we achieve spontaneous back-and-forth motion between metastable states that is up to 350 times faster than unbiased {MD}. We believe this work opens up useful ways to thinking about and dealing with high-dimensional molecular simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To overcome these limitations a framework making use of order parameter fluctuations in conjunction with complex network analysis is investigated. Derived from recent advances in the analysis of single molecule time traces, this approach takes into account the fluctuations around each time point to distinguish between states that have similar values of the order parameter but different dynamics. Snapshots with similar fluctuations are used as nodes of a transition network, the clusterization of which into states provides accurate Markov-state-models of the system under study. Application of the methodology to theoretical models with a noisy order parameter as well as the dynamics of a disordered peptide illustrates the possibility to build accurate descriptions of molecular processes on the sole basis of order parameter time series without using any supplementary information.},

Such projections result in relatively smooth surfaces, but they could mask the complexity of the unprotected surface. Here we introduce an approach to determine the actual (unprojected) free energy surface and apply it to the second β-hairpin of protein G, which has been used as a model system for protein folding. The surface is represented by a disconnectivity graph calculated from a long equilibrium folding-unfolding trajectory. The denatured state is found to have multiple low free energy basins. Nevertheless, the peptide shows exponential kinetics in folding to the native basin. Projected surfaces obtained from the present analysis have a simple form in agreement with other studies of the β-hairpin. The hidden complexity found for the β-hairpin surface suggests that the standard funnel picture of protein folding should be revisited.},

	abstract = {The function of a highly mobile loop in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase was studied by constructing a mutant ({DL}1) using cassette mutagenesis that had four residues deleted in the middle section of the loop (Met 16-Ala 19) and a glycine inserted to seal the gap. This part of the loop involves residues 16-20 and is disordered in the X-ray crystal structures of the apoprotein and the {NADP}+ binary complex but forms a hairpin turn that folds over the nicotinamide moiety of {NADP}+ and the pteridine moiety of folate in the ternary complex [Bystroff, C., \& Kraut, J. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2227-2239]. The steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics and two-dimensional {NMR} spectra were analyzed and compared to the wild-type protein. The kinetics on the {DL}1 mutant enzyme show that the Km value for {NADPH} (5.3 µ ), the Km for dihydrofolate (2 µ ), the rate constant for the release of the product tetrahydrofolate (10.3 s\_1), and the intrinsic {pKa} value (6.2) are similar to those exhibited by the wild-type enzyme. However, the hydride-transfer rate declines markedly from the wild-type value of 950 s{\textasciitilde}* to 1.7 s-1 for the {DL}1 mutant and when taken with data for substrate binding indicates that the loop contributes to substrate flux by a factor of 3.5 X 104. Thus, the mobility of loop I may provide a mechanism of recruiting hydrophobic residues which can properly align the nicotinamide and pteridine rings for the hydride-transfer process (a form of transition-state stabilization). Two-dimensional {NMR} spectra show a slow (on the {NMR} time scale) exchange process at 298 K in the wild-type protein which cannot be detected in the deletion mutant. This slow process in the wild-type protein can be partially attributed to a two-site exchange of some of the residues in loop I. Therefore, the deletion of the hairpin-forming residues in loop I also affects the observed dynamics of the secondary structure in the wild-type protein and thus ties the changes in the kinetic behavior of the {DL}1 protein to the restricted movement of its loop I relative to the wild-type enzyme.},

	abstract = {The reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase ({ecDHFR}) cycles through five detectable kinetic intermediates:  holoenzyme, Michaelis complex, ternary product complex, tetrahydrofolate ({THF}) binary complex, and {THF}·{NADPH} complex. Isomorphous crystal structures analogous to these five intermediates and to the transition state (as represented by the methotrexate·{NADPH} complex) have been used to assemble a 2.1 Å resolution movie depicting loop and subdomain movements during the catalytic cycle (see Supporting Information). The structures suggest that the M20 loop is predominantly closed over the reactants in the holoenzyme, Michaelis, and transition state complexes. But, during the remainder of the cycle, when nicotinamide is not bound, the loop occludes (protrudes into) the nicotinamide−ribose binding pocket. Upon changing from the closed to the occluded conformation, the central portion of the loop rearranges from β-sheet to 310 helix. The change may occur by way of an irregularly structured open loop conformation, which could transiently admit a water molecule into position to protonate N5 of dihydrofolate. From the Michaelis to the transition state analogue complex, rotation between two halves of {ecDHFR}, the adenosine binding subdomain and loop subdomain, closes the (p-aminobenzoyl)glutamate ({pABG}) binding crevice by ≈0.5 Å. Resulting enhancement of contacts with the {pABG} moiety may stabilize puckering at C6 of the pteridine ring in the transition state. The subdomain rotation is further adjusted by cofactor-induced movements (≈0.5 Å) of helices B and C, producing a larger {pABG} cleft in the {THF}·{NADPH} analogue complex than in the {THF} analogue complex. Such movements may explain how {THF} release is assisted by {NADPH} binding. Subdomain rotation is not observed in vertebrate {DHFR} structures, but an analogous loop movement (residues 59−70) appears to similarly adjust the {pABG} cleft width, suggesting that these movements are important for catalysis. Loop movement, also unobserved in vertebrate {DHFR} structures, may preferentially weaken {NADP}+ vs {NADPH} binding in {ecDHFR}, an evolutionary adaptation to reduce product inhibition in the {NADP}+ rich environment of prokaryotes.},

Whereas most of the protein moves less than 1 Å during the simulation, some residues in the active site loop move more than 8 Å during the 10.5 picoseconds of dynamics for each of the simulations. Most interestingly, the nature of the loop motion depends on the substrate, with the largest motion found in the presence of {DHAP}, and only in the presence of {DHAP} does the loop move to “close off” the active site pocket. The final structure found for the {DHAP}-chicken {TIM} complex is qualitatively similar to that described by Alber et al. for {DHAP}-yeast {TIM}.

	abstract = {Conformational changes are crucial for the catalytic action of many enzymes. A prototypical and well-studied example is loop opening and closure in triosephosphate isomerase ({TIM}), which is thought to determine the rate of catalytic turnover in many circumstances. Specifically, {TIM} loop 6 “grips” the phosphodianion of the substrate and, together with a change in loop 7, sets up the {TIM} active site for efficient catalysis. Crystal structures of {TIM} typically show an open or a closed conformation of loop 6, with the tip of the loop moving ∼7 Å between conformations. Many studies have interpreted this motion as a two-state, rigid-body transition. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations, with both conventional and enhanced sampling techniques, to analyze loop motion in apo and substrate-bound {TIM} in detail, using five crystal structures of the dimeric {TIM} from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that loop 6 is highly flexible and samples multiple conformational states. Empirical valence bond simulations of the first reaction step show that slight displacements away from the fully closed-loop conformation can be sufficient to abolish most of the catalytic activity; full closure is required for efficient reaction. The conformational change of the loops in {TIM} is thus not a simple “open and shut” case and is crucial for its catalytic action. Our detailed analysis of loop motion in a highly efficient enzyme highlights the complexity of loop conformational changes and their role in biological catalysis.},

Using holographic optical tweezers to induce coalescence between two aerosol particles (volume {\textless}500 femtolitres), we observe the composite particle relax to a sphere over a timescale from 10−7 to 105 s, dependent on viscosity. The damped oscillations in shape illustrate the interplay of surface capillary forces and bulk fluid flow as the relaxation progresses. Viscosity values estimated from the extrapolation of measurements from macroscopic binary aqueous solutions of sucrose are shown to diverge from the microparticle measurements by as much as five orders of magnitude in the limit of ultrahigh solute supersaturation and viscosity. This is shown to be a consequence of the sensitivity of the viscosity to the composition of the particles, specifically the water content, and the often incorrect compositional dependence on water activity that are assumed to characterise aerosols and amorphous phases under dry conditions. For ternary mixtures of sodium chloride, sucrose and water, the measured viscosities similarly diverge from model predictions by up to three orders of magnitude. The Stokes–Einstein treatment for relating the diffusivity of water in sucrose droplets to the particle viscosity is found to depart from the measured viscosities by more than one order of magnitude when the viscosity exceeds 10 Pa s and up to six orders of magnitude at the highest viscosities accessed. Coalescence is shown to proceed with unit efficiency even up to the highest accessible viscosity. These measurements provide the first comprehensive account of the change in a material property accompanying a transition from a dilute solution to an amorphous semi-solid state using aerosol particles to probe the change in rheological properties.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are useful in obtaining thermodynamic and kinetic properties of bio-molecules, but they are limited by the time scale barrier. That is, we may not obtain properties’ efficiently because we need to run microseconds or longer simulations using femtosecond time steps. To overcome this time scale barrier, we can use the weighted ensemble ({WE}) method, a powerful enhanced sampling method that efficiently samples thermodynamic and kinetic properties. However, the {WE} method requires an appropriate partitioning of phase space into discrete macrostates, which can be problematic when we have a high-dimensional collective space or when little is known a priori about the molecular system. Hence, we developed a new {WE}-based method, called the “Concurrent Adaptive Sampling ({CAS}) algorithm,” to tackle these issues. The {CAS} algorithm is not constrained to use only one or two collective variables, unlike most reaction coordinate-dependent methods. Instead, it can use a large number of collective variables and adaptive macrostates to enhance the sampling in the high-dimensional space. This is especially useful for systems in which we do not know what the right reaction coordinates are, in which case we can use many collective variables to sample conformations and pathways. In addition, a clustering technique based on the committor function is used to accelerate sampling the slowest process in the molecular system. In this paper, we introduce the new method and show results from two-dimensional models and bio-molecules, specifically penta-alanine and a triazine trimer.},

To achieve this, the algorithm uses concepts from the field of reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, which rewards sampling along important degrees of freedom and disregards others that do not facilitate exploration or exploitation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {REAP} by comparing the sampling to long continuous {MD} simulations and least-counts adaptive sampling on two model landscapes (L-shaped and circular) and realistic systems such as alanine dipeptide and Src kinase. In all four systems, the {REAP} algorithm consistently demonstrates its ability to explore conformational space faster than the other two methods when comparing the expected values of the landscape discovered for a given amount of time.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations that capture the spontaneous binding of drugs and other ligands to their target proteins can reveal a great deal of useful information, but most drug-like ligands bind on time scales longer than those accessible to individual {MD} simulations. Adaptive sampling methods―in which one performs multiple rounds of simulation, with the initial conditions of each round based on the results of previous rounds―offer a promising potential solution to this problem. No comprehensive analysis of the performance gains from adaptive sampling is available for ligand binding, however, particularly for protein–ligand systems typical of those encountered in drug discovery. Moreover, most previous work presupposes knowledge of the ligand’s bound pose. Here we outline existing methods for adaptive sampling of the ligand-binding process and introduce several improvements, with a focus on methods that do not require prior knowledge of the binding site or bound pose. We then evaluate these methods by comparing them to traditional, long {MD} simulations for realistic protein–ligand systems. We find that adaptive sampling simulations typically fail to reach the bound pose more efficiently than traditional {MD}. However, adaptive sampling identifies multiple potential binding sites more efficiently than traditional {MD} and also provides better characterization of binding pathways. We explain these results by showing that protein–ligand binding is an example of an exploration–exploitation dilemma. Existing adaptive sampling methods for ligand binding in the absence of a known bound pose vastly favor the broad exploration of protein–ligand space, sometimes failing to sufficiently exploit intermediate states as they are discovered. We suggest potential avenues for future research to address this shortcoming.},

	abstract = {Classical molecular dynamics simulates the time evolution of molecular systems through the phase space spanned by the positions and velocities of the constituent atoms. Molecular-level thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural data extracted from the resulting trajectories provide valuable information for the understanding, engineering, and design of biological and molecular materials. The cost of simulating many-body atomic systems makes simulations of large molecules prohibitively expensive, and the high-dimensionality of the resulting trajectories presents a challenge for analysis. Driven by advances in algorithms, hardware, and data availability, there has been a flare of interest in recent years in the applications of machine learning – especially deep learning – to molecular simulation. These techniques have demonstrated great power and flexibility in both extracting mechanistic understanding of the important nonlinear collective variables governing the dynamics of a molecular system, and in furnishing good low-dimensional system representations with which to perform enhanced sampling or develop long-timescale dynamical models. It is the purpose of this article to introduce the key machine learning approaches, describe how they are married with statistical mechanical theory into domain-specific tools, and detail applications of these approaches in understanding and accelerating biomolecular simulation.},

In this work, we illustrate how this nonlinear latent embedding can be used as a collective variable for enhanced sampling and present a simple modification that allows us to rapidly perform sampling in multiple related systems. We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning about a model using {AMBER}99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis ({tICA}). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the {WW} domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the {GTT} mutation. This method shows promise for its ability to rapidly sample related systems using a single transferable collective variable, enabling us to probe the effects of variation in increasingly large systems of biophysical interest.},

	abstract = {The sampling problem lies at the heart of atomistic simulations and over the years many different enhanced sampling methods have been suggested toward its solution. These methods are often grouped into two broad families. On the one hand, are methods such as umbrella sampling and metadynamics that build a bias potential based on few order parameters or collective variables. On the other hand, are tempering methods such as replica exchange that combine different thermodynamic ensembles in one single expanded ensemble. We instead adopt a unifying perspective, focusing on the target probability distribution sampled by the different methods. This allows us to introduce a new class of collective-variables-based bias potentials that can be used to sample any of the expanded ensembles normally sampled via replica exchange. We also provide a practical implementation by properly adapting the iterative scheme of the recently developed on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling method [M. Invernizzi and M. Parrinello, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 2731 (2020)], which was originally introduced for metadynamicslike sampling. The resulting method is very general and can be used to achieve different types of enhanced sampling. It is also reliable and simple to use, since it presents only few and robust external parameters and has a straightforward reweighting scheme. Furthermore, it can be used with any number of parallel replicas. We show the versatility of our approach with applications to multicanonical and multithermal-multibaric simulations, thermodynamic integration, umbrella sampling, and combinations thereof.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In order to advance the mission of \textit{in silico} cell biology, modeling the interactions of large and complex biological systems becomes increasingly relevant. The combination of molecular dynamics ({MD}) and Markov state models ({MSMs}) have enabled the construction of simplified models of molecular kinetics on long timescales. Despite its success, this approach is inherently limited by the size of the molecular system. With increasing size of macromolecular complexes, the number of independent or weakly coupled subsystems increases, and the number of global system states increase exponentially, making the sampling of all distinct global states unfeasible. In this work, we present a technique called Independent Markov Decomposition ({IMD}) that leverages weak coupling between subsystems in order to compute a global kinetic model without requiring to sample all combinatorial states of subsystems. We give a theoretical basis for {IMD} and propose an approach for finding and validating such a decomposition. Using empirical few-state {MSMs} of ion channel models that are well established in electrophysiology, we demonstrate that {IMD} can reproduce experimental conductance measurements with a major reduction in sampling compared with a standard {MSM} approach. We further show how to find the optimal partition of all-atom protein simulations into weakly coupled subunits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance Statement{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Molecular simulations of proteins are often interpreted using Markov state models ({MSMs}), in which each protein configuration is assigned to a global state. As we explore larger and more complex biological systems, the size of this global state space will face a combinatorial explosion, rendering it impossible to gather sufficient sampling data. In this work, we introduce an approach to decompose a system of interest into separable subsystems. We show that {MSMs} built for each subsystem can be later coupled to reproduce the behaviors of the global system. To aid in the choice of decomposition we also describe a score to quantify its goodness. This decomposition strategy has the promise to enable robust modeling of complex biomolecular systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The retrieval relies on combining mass-to-charge data and size data from light scattering. Here, we use a combination of low- and high-resolution Mie resonance spectroscopy to obtain radius data, enabling an accurate size determination not only when the particle is in equilibrium, but also when it is out of equilibrium due to kinetic limitation of mass transport. With the data measured under non-equilibrium conditions, it is possible to retrieve the water diffusivity. A challenge is that the radius retrieval by comparing measured light scattering with Mie theory requires the knowledge of refractive index as a function of concentration. Here, we show an iterative retrieval of refractive index and size for compounds for which data cannot be obtained in the bulk either due to lack of sufficient amounts of sample or limited solubility. We demonstrate the measurement strategy and the retrieval of water activity, density, refractive index and water diffusivity for aqueous shikimic acid. Water diffusivity in concentrated shikimic acid decreases by 6 orders of magnitude at 250 K compared to that at room temperature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) from simple and substituted cycloalkenes (C$_{\textrm{5}}$-C$_{\textrm{8}}$) is produced in dark ozonolysis experiments in a dry chamber (\textit{{RH}}{\textasciitilde}5\%). Biogenic {SOA} from monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and oxygenated terpenes is formed by photooxidation in a humid chamber ({\textasciitilde}50\% \textit{{RH}}). Using the hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer ({HTDMA}), we measure the diameter-based hygroscopic growth factor (\textit{{GF}}) of the {SOA} as a function of time and relative humidity. All {SOA} studied is found to be slightly hygroscopic, with smaller water uptake than that of typical inorganic aerosol substances. The aerosol water uptake increases with time early in the experiments for the cycloalkene {SOA}, but decreases with time for the sesquiterpene {SOA}. This behavior could indicate competing effects between the formation of more highly oxidized polar compounds (more hygroscopic), and formation of longer-chained oligomers (less hygroscopic). All {SOA} also exhibit a smooth water uptake with \textit{{RH}} with no deliquescence or efflorescence. The water uptake curves are found to be fitted well with an empirical three-parameter functional form. The measured pure organic \textit{{GF}} values at 85\% \textit{{RH}} are between 1.09\&ndash;1.16 for {SOA} from ozonolysis of cycloalkenes, 1.01\&ndash;1.04 for sesquiterpene photooxidation {SOA}, and 1.06\&ndash;1.10 for the monoterpene and oxygenated terpene {SOA}. The \textit{{GF}} of pure {SOA} (\textit{{GF}}$_{\textrm{org}}$) in experiments in which inorganic seed aerosol is used is determined by assuming volume-weighted water uptake (Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson or "{ZSR}" approach) and using the size-resolved organic mass fraction measured by the Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer. Knowing the water content associated with the inorganic fraction yields \textit{{GF}}$_{\textrm{org}}$ values. However, for each precursor, the \textit{{GF}}$_{\textrm{org}}$ values computed from different {HTDMA}-classified diameters agree with each other to varying degrees. Comparing growth factors from different precursors, we find that \textit{{GF}}$_{\textrm{org}}$ is inversely proportional to the precursor molecular weight and {SOA} yield, which is likely a result of the fact that higher-molecular weight precursors tend to produce larger and less hygroscopic oxidation products.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this Feature Article, we highlight some recent advances that greatly facilitate structure prediction and analysis of global thermodynamics and kinetics in proteins and nucleic acids. The geometry optimisation procedures, on which these calculations are based, can be accelerated significantly using local rigidification of selected degrees of freedom, and through implementations on graphics processing units. Results of progressive local rigidification are first summarised for trpzip1, including a systematic analysis of the heat capacity and rearrangement rates. Benchmarks for all the essential optimisation procedures are then provided for a variety of proteins. Applications are then illustrated from a study of how mutation affects the energy landscape for a coiled-coil protein, and for transitions in helix morphology for a {DNA} duplex. Both systems exhibit an intrinsically multifunnel landscape, with the potential to act as biomolecular switches.},

	abstract = {The stationary points of a potential energy surface provide a convenient framework for coarse-graining calculations of thermodynamics and kinetics. Thermodynamic properties can be extracted from a database of local minima using the superposition approach, where the total partition function is written as a sum over the contributions from each minimum. To analyse kinetics, we must also consider the transition states that link individual local minima, and evaluate rate constants for the corresponding elementary rearrangements. For small molecules the assignment of separate thermodynamic quantities, such as free energies, to individual isomers, and the notion of isomerisation rates between these structures, is usually straightforward. However, for larger systems the experimental states of interest generally correspond to sets of local minima with some common feature, such as a particular structural motif. This review focuses upon the discrete path sampling approach to obtaining phenomenological two-state rate constants between ensembles of local minima that are distinguished by suitable order parameters. Examples are discussed for atomic and molecular clusters, and for two peptides. Contents {PAGE}1. Introduction 2382. Discrete path sampling 2402.1. Rate constant formulations2402.2.

	abstract = {Recent attempts have been made to assess the relative merits of the free volume and entropy theories of viscous flow in glass‐forming liquids by accurate measurement of viscosity over wide temperature ranges, and subsequent comparison with the equations derived from these theories. In the author's view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropy theory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in “viscous” liquids (shear relaxation time ≥10−9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.},

Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly.

Typically, however, multiple lagtimes are used and analyzed as input parameters, yet convergence with respect to the choice of lagtime is not always possible. Here, we present a simple method for calculating the slowest relaxation time ({RT}) of the system in the limit of very long lagtimes. Our approach relies on the fact that the second eigenvector’s autocorrelation function of the propagator will be approximately single exponential at long lagtimes. This allows us to obtain a simple equation for the behavior of the {MSM}’s relaxation time as a function of the lagtime with only two free parameters, one of these being the {RT} of the system. We demonstrate that the second parameter is a useful indicator of how Markovian a selected variable is for building the {MSM}. Fitting this function to data gives a limiting value for the optimal variational {RT}. Testing this on analytic and molecular dynamics data for Ala5 and umbrella sampling-biased ion channel simulations shows that the function accurately describes the behavior of the {RT} and furthermore that this {RT} can improve noticeably the value calculated at the longest accessible lagtime. We compare our {RT} limit to the hidden Markov model ({HMM}) approach that typically finds {RTs} of comparable values. However, {HMMs} cannot be used in conjunction with biased simulation data, requiring more complex algorithms to construct than {MSMs}, and the derived {RTs} are not variational, leading to ambiguity in the choice of lagtime at which to build the {HMM}.},

We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique, called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts {TEM} specificity by accounting for conformational heterogeneity. Using our {MSMs}, we identify hidden states whose populations correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models’ prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced Ω-loop flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in drug and protein design.},

Given the enormity of conformational space, there has been ongoing interest in identifying a small number of states that capture the essential features of a protein. Generally, this is achieved by making assumptions about the properties of relevant features—for example, that the most important features are those that change slowly. An alternative strategy is to keep as many degrees of freedom as possible and subsequently learn from the model which of the features are most important. In these larger models, however, traditional approaches quickly become computationally intractable. In this paper, we present enspara, a library for working with {MSMs} that provides several novel algorithms and specialized data structures that dramatically improve the scalability of traditional {MSM} methods. This includes ragged arrays for minimizing memory requirements, message passing interface-parallelized implementations of compute-intensive operations, and a ﬂexible framework for model construction and analysis.},

Protein-{DNA} binding often involves dramatic conformational changes such as protein folding and {DNA} bending. While thermodynamic aspects of this behavior are understood, and its biological function is often known, the mechanism by which the conformational changes occur is generally unclear. By providing detailed structural and energetic data, molecular dynamics simulations have been helpful in elucidating and rationalizing protein-{DNA} binding.
Scope of review
This review will summarize recent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the conformational dynamics of {DNA} and protein-{DNA} binding. A brief overview of recent developments in {DNA} force fields is given as well.
Major conclusions
Simulations have been crucial in rationalizing the intrinsic flexibility of {DNA}, and have been instrumental in identifying the sequence of binding events, the triggers for the conformational motion, and the mechanism of binding for a number of important {DNA}-binding proteins.
General significance
Molecular dynamics simulations are an important tool for understanding the complex binding behavior of {DNA}-binding proteins. With recent advances in force fields and rapid increases in simulation time scales, simulations will become even more important for future studies.

	abstract = {Triosephosphate isomerase ({TIM}) catalyzes the stereospecific 1,2-proton shift at dihydroxyacetone phosphate ({DHAP}) to give (R)-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate through a pair of isomeric enzyme-bound cis-enediolate phosphate intermediates. The chemical transformations that occur at the active site of {TIM} were well understood by the early 1990s. The mechanism for enzyme-catalyzed isomerization is similar to that for the nonenzymatic reaction in water, but the origin of the catalytic rate acceleration is not understood. We review the results of experimental work that show that a substantial fraction of the large 12 kcal/mol intrinsic binding energy of the nonreacting phosphodianion fragment of {TIM} is utilized to activate the active site side chains for catalysis of proton transfer. Evidence is presented that this activation is due to a phosphodianion-driven conformational change, the most dramatic feature of which is closure of loop 6 over the dianion. The kinetic data are interpreted within the framework of a model in which activation is due to the stabilization by the phosphodianion of a rare, desolvated, loop-closed form of {TIM}. The dianion binding energy is proposed to drive the otherwise thermodynamically unfavorable desolvation of the solvent-exposed active site. This reduces the effective local dielectric constant of the active site, to enhance stabilizing electrostatic interactions between polar groups and the anionic transition state, and increases the basicity of the carboxylate side chain of Glu-165 that functions to deprotonate the bound carbon acid substrate. A rebuttal is presented to the recent proposal [Samanta, M., Murthy, M. R. N., Balaram, H., and Balaram, P. (2011) {ChemBioChem} 12, 1886–1895] that the cationic side chain of K12 functions as an active site electrophile to protonate the carbonyl oxygen of {DHAP}.},

The present study probes the conformational dynamics of single β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs) in the solution phase by {AntiBrownian} {ELectrokinetic} ({ABEL}) trapping. The {ABEL} trap uses fast electrokinetic feedback in a microﬂuidic conﬁguration to allow direct observation of a single ﬂuorescently labeled β2AR for hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. By choosing a reporter dye and labeling site sensitive to ligand binding, we observe a diversity of discrete ﬂuorescence intensity and lifetime levels in single β2ARs, indicating a varying radiative lifetime and a range of discrete conformational states with dwell times of hundreds of milliseconds. We ﬁnd that the binding of agonist increases the dwell times of these states, and furthermore, we observe millisecond ﬂuctuations within states. The intensity autocorrelations of these faster ﬂuctuations are well-described by stretched exponential functions with a stretching exponent β ∼ 0.5, suggesting protein dynamics over a range of time scales.},

The dynamics of these processes, approached through a variety of kinetic methods, are discussed. The results obtained for many different enzymes suggest that multiple intermediates and conformations are general characteristics of the catalytic process and allosteric regulation. Ribonuclease, dihydrofolate reductase, chymotrypsin, aspartate aminotransferase, and aspartate transcarbamoylase are considered as specific examples. Typical and maximum rates of conformational changes and catalysis are also discussed, based on results obtained from model systems. The nature and rates of interconversion of the intermediates, along with structural information, can be used as the bases for understanding the incredible catalytic efficiency of enzymes. Potential roles of conformational changes in the catalytic process are discussed in terms of static and environmental effects, and in terms of dynamic coupling within the enzyme−substrate complex.},

Reaching a complete mechanistic understanding of large-scale conformational transformations underlying the activation of kinases could greatly help in the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. In principle, the nature of conformational transition could be modelled in silico via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, although this is very challenging because of the long activation timescales. Here we employ a computational paradigm that couples transition pathway techniques and Markov state model-based massively distributed simulations for mapping the conformational landscape of c-src tyrosine kinase. The computations provide the thermodynamics and kinetics of kinase activation for the first time, and help identify key structural intermediates. Furthermore, the presence of a novel allosteric site in an intermediate state of c-src that could be potentially used for drug design is predicted.},

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) are typically trained by backpropagation in a batch learning setting, which requires the entire training data to be made available prior to the learning task. This is not scalable for many real-world scenarios where new data arrives sequentially in a stream form. We aim to address an open challenge of "Online Deep Learning" ({ODL}) for learning {DNNs} on the fly in an online setting. Unlike traditional online learning that often optimizes some convex objective function with respect to a shallow model (e.g., a linear/kernel-based hypothesis), {ODL} is significantly more challenging since the optimization of the {DNN} objective function is non-convex, and regular backpropagation does not work well in practice, especially for online learning settings. In this paper, we present a new online deep learning framework that attempts to tackle the challenges by learning {DNN} models of adaptive depth from a sequence of training data in an online learning setting. In particular, we propose a novel Hedge Backpropagation ({HBP}) method for online updating the parameters of {DNN} effectively, and validate the efficacy of our method on large-scale data sets, including both stationary and concept drifting scenarios.},

Detailed, physics-based simulation methods are demonstrating rapidly growing impact in areas as diverse as biocatalysis, drug delivery, biomaterials, biotechnology, and drug design. Simulations offer the potential of uniquely detailed, atomic-level insight into mechanisms, dynamics, and processes, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of molecular properties. Simulations can now be used as computational assays of biological activity, for example, in predictions of drug resistance. Methodological and algorithmic developments, combined with advances in computational hardware, are transforming the scope and range of calculations. Different types of methods are required for different types of problem. Accurate methods and extensive simulations promise quantitative comparison with experiments across biochemistry. Atomistic simulations can now access experimentally relevant timescales for large systems, leading to a fertile interplay of experiment and theory and offering unprecedented opportunities for validating and developing models. Coarse-grained methods allow studies on larger length- and timescales, and theoretical developments are bringing electronic structure calculations into new regimes. Multiscale methods are another key focus for development, combining different levels of theory to increase accuracy, aiming to connect chemical and molecular changes to macroscopic observables.

This article introduces {ART} 2, a class of adaptive resonance architectures which rapidly self-organize pattern recognition categories in response to arbitrary sequences of either analog or binary input patterns. In order to cope with arbitrary sequences of analog input patterns, {ART} 2 architectures embody solutions to a number of design principles, such as the stability-plasticity tradeoff, the search-direct access tradeoff, and the match-reset tradeoff. In these architectures, top-down learned expectation and matching mechanisms are critical in self-stabilizing the code learning process. A parallel search scheme updates itself adaptively as the learning process unfolds, and realizes a form of real-time hypothesis discovery, testing, learning, and recognition. After learning self-stabilizes, the search process is automatically disengaged. Thereafter input patterns directly access their recognition codes without any search. Thus recognition time for familiar inputs does not increase with the complexity of the learned code. A novel input pattern can directly access a category if it shares invariant properties with the set of familiar exemplars of that category. A parameter called the attentional vigilance parameter determines how fine the categories will be. If vigilance increases (decreases) due to environmental feedback, then the system automatically searches for and learns finer (coarser) recognition categories. Gain control parameters enable the architecture to suppress noise up to a prescribed level. The architecture's global design enables it to learn effectively despite the high degree of nonlinearity of such mechanisms.},

	abstract = {A density-based clustering method is proposed that is deterministic, computationally efficient, and self-consistent in its parameter choice. By calculating a geometric coordinate space density for every point of a given data set, a local free energy is defined. On the basis of these free energy estimates, the frames are lumped into local free energy minima, ultimately forming microstates separated by local free energy barriers. The algorithm is embedded into a complete workflow to robustly generate Markov state models from molecular dynamics trajectories. It consists of (i) preprocessing of the data via principal component analysis in order to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, (ii) proposed density-based clustering to generate microstates, and (iii) dynamical clustering via the most probable path algorithm to construct metastable states. To characterize the resulting state-resolved conformational distribution, dihedral angle content color plots are introduced which identify structural differences of protein states in a concise way. To illustrate the performance of the method, three well-established model problems are adopted: conformational transitions of hepta-alanine, folding of villin headpiece, and functional dynamics of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.},

The {MSM} requires the construction of a discrete state-space such that two points are in the same state if they can interconvert rapidly. In the following, we suggest an improved method, which utilizes second order Independent Component Analysis (also known as time-structure based Independent Component Analysis, or {tICA}), to construct the state-space. We apply this method to simulations of {NTL}9 (provided by Lindorﬀ-Larsen et al.

	abstract = {Several methods have been developed in the past few years for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of biological (macro)molecules whose complexity is difficult to capture by simple projections of the free-energy surface onto one or two geometric variables. The locally scaled diffusion map ({LSDMap}) method is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for describing the dynamics of complex systems in terms of a few collective coordinates. Here, we compare {LSDMap} to two previously developed approaches for the characterization of the configurational landscape associated with the folding dynamics of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet peptide, termed Beta3s. The analysis is aided by an improved procedure for extracting pathways from the equilibrium transition network, which enables calculation of pathway-specific cut-based free energy profiles. We find that the results from {LSDMap} are consistent with analysis based on transition networks and allow a coherent interpretation of metastable states and folding pathways in terms of different time scales of transitions between minima on the free energy projections.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins fold from disordered amino-acid chains to spatially ordered structures remains an area of active inquiry. Molecular simulations can provide atomistic details of the folding dynamics which complement experimental findings. Conventional order parameters, such as root-mean-square deviation and radius of gyration, provide structural information but fail to capture the underlying dynamics of the protein folding process. It is therefore advantageous to adopt a method that can systematically analyze simulation data to extract relevant structural as well as dynamical information. The nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique known as diffusion maps automatically embeds the high-dimensional folding trajectories in a lower-dimensional space from which one can more easily visualize folding pathways, assuming the data lie approximately on a lower-dimensional manifold. The eigenvectors that parametrize the low-dimensional space, furthermore, are determined systematically, rather than chosen heuristically, as is done with phenomenological order parameters. We demonstrate that diffusion maps can effectively characterize the folding process of a Trp-cage miniprotein. By embedding molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of Trp-cage folding in diffusion maps space, we identify two folding pathways and intermediate structures that are consistent with the previous studies, demonstrating that this technique can be employed as an effective way of analyzing and constructing protein folding pathways from molecular simulations.},

Trajectory-based frameworks can also generate ideal (but abstract) reaction coordinates such as committors and eigenfunctions of the master equation. However, rates and mechanistic insights obtained from trajectory-based methods and abstract coordinates are not readily generalized across simulation conditions or reaction families. We discuss methods for identifying physically meaningful reaction coordinates, including committor analysis, variational transition state theory, Kramers–Langer–Berezhkovskii–Szabo theory, and statistical inference methods that can use path sampling data to screen, mix, and optimize thousands of trial coordinates.

This makes dimensionality reduction problematic because the data does not satisfy the assumptions made in conventional manifold learning algorithms We therefore propose that when dimensionality reduction is performed on trajectory data one should think of the resultant embedding as a quickly sketched set of directions rather than a road map. In other words, the embedding tells one about the connectivity between states but does not provide the vectors that correspond to the slow degrees of freedom. This realization informs the development of sketch-map, which endeavors to reproduce the proximity information from the high-dimensionality description in a space of lower dimensionality even when a faithful embedding is not possible.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis ({PCA}) and multidimensional scaling ({MDS}), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

We propose a general approach to this problem to obtain a few collective coordinates by using nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We validate the usefulness of this method by characterizing the folding landscape associated with a coarse-grained protein model of src homology 3 as sampled by molecular dynamics simulations. The folding free-energy landscape projected on the few relevant coordinates emerging from the dimensionality reduction can correctly identify the transition-state ensemble of the reaction. The first embedding dimension efficiently captures the evolution of the folding process along the main folding route. These results clearly show that the proposed method can efficiently find a low-dimensional representation of a complex process such as protein folding.},

Even with today's seemingly fast pace of {AI} breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out to be much harder than many people expected. One reason for these repeating cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence itself.

Elucidation of conformational sub states in this way both illustrates the degree of conformational convergence in the simulation and reduces the structural data to a tractable subset. The relative movement of structures upon energy minimization was used to estimate the sizes of features on the protein potential energy surface. The structures were analyzed using their pairwise root-mean-square Cα deviations, which gave a global measure of conformational changes that would not be apparent by monitoring single degrees of freedom. At time scales of 0.1 ps, energy minimization detected sharp transitions between energy minima separated by 0.1 Å rms deviation. Larger conformational clusters containing these smaller minima and separated by 0.25 Å were seen at 1 ps time scales. Both of these small features of the conformational landscape were characterized by movements in loop regions associated with small, correlated backbone dihedral angle shifts. On a nanosecond time scale, the main features of the protein energy landscape were clusters separated by over 0.7 Å rms deviation, with only seven of these sub states visited over the 1 ns trajectory. These substates, discernible both before and after energy minimization, differ mainly in a monotonic pivot of the loop residues 11–18 over the course of the simulation. This loop contains lysine 17, which specifically binds to trypsin in the active site. The trajectory did not return to previously visited clusters, indicating that this trajectory has not been shown to have completely sampled the conformational substates available to it. Because the apparent convergence to a single region of conformation space depends on both the time scale of observation and the size of the conformational features examined, convergence must be operationally defined within the context of the simulation. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Using principal component analysis, the simulations are interpreted in view of dynamic domains and hinges promoting relative motions of these domains. Two domains with residues 7–22 and 52–108 for the first domain and residues 25–51 for the second domain were consistently observed. Hinge regions consist primarily of Tyr24, Ser50, Ile51, and Gly52. Earlier mutation studies have demonstrated that the residues of the hinge regions play essential roles for the stability and activity of barnase. The domain motions are correlated to inter-domain interactions involving functionally important active site residues, such as Lys27 and Glu73. A model is presented that combines the observation of dynamic domains and their motions with the extensive mutation data from the literature. Enthalpic energy contributions originating from specific inter-domain interactions as well as entropic energy contributions due to the domain motions are discussed in the frame of this model and compared with destabilization energies measured for corresponding mutants.

Simulations with the Milestoning algorithm suggest Mean First Passage Time ({MFPT}) of {\textasciitilde}4 h and the presence of a large barrier at the center of the bilayer. A similar calculation with the solubility-diffusion model yields {MFPT} of {\textasciitilde}15 min. This permeation rate is nine orders of magnitude slower than the permeation rate of only a tryptophan side chain (computed by us and others). This difference suggests critical dependence of transport time on permeant size and hydrophilicity. Analysis of the simulation results suggests that the permeant partially preserves hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone to water and lipid molecules even when it is moving closer to the bilayer center. As a consequence, defects of the membrane structure are developed to assist permeation.},

Experimental and theoretical analyses of the role of changes in {HIV} reverse transcriptase structure in selecting a correct substrate are presented. Atomically detailed simulations using the Milestoning method predict a rate and free energy profile of the conformational change commensurate with experimental data. A large conformational change occurring on a millisecond timescale locks the correct nucleotide at the active site but promotes release of a mismatched nucleotide. The positions along the reaction coordinate that decide the yield of the reaction are not determined by the chemical step. Rather, the initial steps of weak substrate binding and protein conformational transition significantly enrich the yield of a reaction with a correct substrate, whereas the same steps diminish the reaction probability of an incorrect substrate.},

	abstract = {Milestoning is a method for calculating kinetics and thermodynamics of long time processes typically not accessible for straightforward Molecular Dynamics ({MD}) simulation. In the Milestoning approach, the system of interest is partitioned into cells by dividing hypersurfaces (Milestones) and transitions are computed between nearby hypersurfaces. Kinetics and thermodynamics are derived from the statistics of these transitions. The original Milestoning work concentrated on systems in which a one-dimensional reaction coordinate or an order parameter could be identified. In many biomolecular processes, the reaction proceeds via multiple channels or following more than a single-order parameter. A description based on a one-dimensional reaction coordinate may be insufficient. In the present paper, we introduce a variation that overcomes this limitation. Following the ideas of Vanden-Eijnden and Venturoli on Voronoi cells that avoid the use of an order parameter (J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 194101), we describe another way to “Milestone” systems without a reaction coordinate. We examine the assumptions of the Milestoning calculations of mean first passage times ({MFPT}) and describe strategies to weaken these assumptions. The method described in this paper, Directional Milestoning, arranges hypersurfaces in higher dimensions that “tag” trajectories such that efficient calculations can be done and at the same time the assumptions required for exact calculations of {MFPTs} are satisfied approximately. In the original Milestoning papers, trajectories are initiated from an equilibrium set of conformations. Here a more accurate distribution, that mimics the first hitting point distribution, is used. We demonstrate the usage of Directional Milestoning in conformational transitions of alanine dipeptide (in vacuum and in aqueous solution) and compare the correctness, efficiency, and statistical stability of the method with exact {MD} and with a related method.},

Previous experimental studies showed that {HMGB}1a's binding affinity for Cp- and Ox-{DNA} varies with the drug used and the local {DNA} sequence context of the adduct. We link this differential binding affinity to the free energy of deforming (bending and minor groove opening) the drug-{DNA} molecule during {HMGB}1a binding. Specifically, the minimal binding affinity of {HMGB}1a for Ox-{DNA} in the {TGGA} context is explained by its larger deformation free energy compared with Cp-{DNA} or Ox-{DNA} in other sequence contexts. Methyl groups on neighboring thymine bases in Ox-{TGGA} crowd the minor groove and sterically hinder the motion of the diaminocyclohexane ring of Ox, leading to this reduced deformability and resultant decrease in {HMGB}1a's binding affinity.},

Straightforward molecular dynamics and replica exchange methods both have severe convergence problems, whereas transition path sampling allows us to sample unbiased dynamical pathways between folded and unfolded states and leads to deeper understanding of the mechanisms of (un)folding. In contrast to previous predictions employing an implicit solvent, we find that Trp-cage folds primarily (80\% of the paths) via a pathway forming the tertiary contacts and the salt bridge, before helix formation. The remaining 20\% of the paths occur in the opposite order, by first forming the helix. The transition states of the rate-limiting steps are solvated native-like structures. Water expulsion is found to be the last step upon folding for each route. Committor analysis suggests that the dynamics of the solvent is not part of the reaction coordinate. Nevertheless, during the transition, specific water molecules are strongly bound and can play a structural role in the folding.},

A new variant of {FFS} is proposed and implemented that allows a better control of a constant flux of partial paths. A reaction coordinate model was obtained, at no extra cost, from the transition path ensemble generated by {FFS}, through iterative use of the {FFS}-least-square estimation method [E. E.

	abstract = {In this paper, a Bayesian approach is developed for simultaneously comparing multiple experimental treatments with a common control treatment in an exploratory clinical trial. The sample size is set to ensure that, at the end of the study, there will be at least one treatment for which the investigators have a strong belief that it is better than control, or else they have a strong belief that none of the experimental treatments are substantially better than control. This criterion bears a direct relationship with conventional frequentist power requirements, while allowing prior opinion to feature in the analysis with a consequent reduction in sample size. If it is concluded that at least one of the experimental treatments shows promise, then it is envisaged that one or more of these promising treatments will be developed further in a definitive phase {III} trial. The approach is developed in the context of normally distributed responses sharing a common standard deviation regardless of treatment. To begin with, the standard deviation will be assumed known when the sample size is calculated. The final analysis will not rely upon this assumption, although the intended properties of the design may not be achieved if the anticipated standard deviation turns out to be inappropriate. Methods that formally allow for uncertainty about the standard deviation, expressed in the form of a Bayesian prior, are then explored. Illustrations of the sample sizes computed from the new method are presented, and comparisons are made with frequentist methods devised for the same situation.

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of efﬁcient exploration of unseen environments, a key challenge in {AI}. We propose a ‘learning to explore’ framework where we learn a policy from a distribution of environments. At test time, presented with an unseen environment from the same distribution, the policy aims to generalize the exploration strategy to visit the maximum number of unique states in a limited number of steps. We particularly focus on environments with graph-structured state-spaces that are encountered in many important real-world applications like software testing and map building. We formulate this task as a reinforcement learning problem where the ‘exploration’ agent is rewarded for transitioning to previously unseen environment states and employ a graph-structured memory to encode the agent’s past trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is extremely effective for exploration of spatial maps; and when applied on the challenging problems of coverage-guided software-testing of domain-speciﬁc programs and real-world mobile applications, it outperforms methods that have been hand-engineered by human experts.},

However, this often continuous representation is not natural for understanding chemical space as a domain and is particular to samples and their differences. We focus on exploring a natural structure for representing chemical space as a structured domain: embedding drug-like chemical space into an enumerable hypergraph based on scaffold classes linked through an inclusion operator. This paper shows how molecules form classes of scaffolds, how scaffolds relate to each in a hypergraph, and how this structure of scaffolds is natural for drug discovery workflows such as predicting properties and optimizing molecular structures. We compare the assumptions and utility of various embeddings of molecules, such as their respective induced distance metrics, their extendibility to represent chemical space as a structured domain, and the consequences of utilizing the structure for learning tasks.},

However, due to the limited labeled data and the giant chemical space, machine learning models trained via supervised learning perform poorly in generalization. This greatly limits the applications of machine learning methods for molecular design and discovery. In this work, we present {MolCLR}: Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations via Graph Neural Networks ({GNNs}), a self-supervised learning framework for large unlabeled molecule datasets. Specifically, we first build a molecular graph, where each node represents an atom and each edge represents a chemical bond. A {GNN} is then used to encode the molecule graph. We propose three novel molecule graph augmentations: atom masking, bond deletion, and subgraph removal. A contrastive estimator is utilized to maximize the agreement of different graph augmentations from the same molecule. Experiments show that molecule representations learned by {MolCLR} can be transferred to multiple downstream molecular property prediction tasks. Our method thus achieves state-of-the-art performance on many challenging datasets. We also prove the efficiency of our proposed molecule graph augmentations on supervised molecular classification tasks.},

Using malate dehydrogenase ({MDH}) as a template enzyme, we show that 24\% (13 out of 55 tested) of the {ProteinGAN}-generated and experimentally tested sequences are soluble and display {MDH} catalytic activity in the tested conditions in vitro, including a highly mutated variant of 106 amino-acid substitutions. {ProteinGAN} therefore demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to rapidly generate highly diverse functional proteins within the allowed biological constraints of the sequence space.},

While the approach is alchemical, the implementation of {ATM} is as straightforward as for physical pathway methods of binding. The method is applicable in principle with any force field, it does not require splitting the alchemical transformations into electrostatic and non-electrostatic steps, and it does not require soft-core pair potentials. We have implemented {ATM} as a freely available and open-source plugin of the {OpenMM} molecular dynamics library. The method and its implementation are validated on the {SAMPL}6 {SAMPLing} host-guest benchmark set. The work paves the way to streamlined alchemical relative and absolute binding free energy implementations on many molecular simulation packages and with arbitrary energy functions including polarizable, quantum-mechanical, and artificial neural network potentials.},

In this work we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families.

Molecular assembly theory provides an approach to explore and compare the intrinsic complexity of molecules by the minimum number of steps needed to build up the target graphs, and here we show this can be applied to networks of molecules to explore the assembly properties of common motifs, rather than just focusing on molecules in isolation. This means molecular assembly theory can be used to define a tree of assembly spaces, allowing us to explore the accessible molecules connected to the tree, rather than the entire space of possible molecules. This approach provides a way to map the relationship between the molecules and their common fragments and thus measures the distribution of structural information collectively embedded in the molecules. We apply this approach to prebiotic chemistry, specifically the construction of {RNA}, and a family of opiates and plasticizers, as well as to gene sequences. This analysis allows us to quantify the amount of external information needed to assemble the tree and identify and predict new components in this family of molecules, based on the contingent information in the assembly spaces.},

	abstract = {Understanding what drives proteins
Computational molecular physics ({CMP}) aims to leverage the laws of physics to understand not just static structures but also the motions and actions of biomolecules. Applying {CMP} to proteins has required either simplifying the physical models or running simulations that are shorter than the time scale of the biological activity. Brini et al. reviewed advances that are moving {CMP} to time scales that match biological events such as protein folding, ligand unbinding, and some conformational changes. They also highlight the role of blind competitions in driving the field forward. New methods such as deep learning approaches are likely to make {CMP} an increasingly powerful tool in describing proteins in action.

Structured Abstract
{BACKGROUNDUnderstanding} biology, particularly at the level of actionable drug discovery, is often a matter of developing accurate stories about how proteins work. This requires understanding the physics of the system, and physics-based computer modeling is a prime tool for that. However, the computational molecular physics ({CMP}) of proteins has previously been much too expensive and slow. A large fraction of public supercomputing resources worldwide is currently running {CMP} simulations of biologically relevant systems. We review here the history and status of this large and diverse scientific enterprise. Among other things, protein modeling has driven major computer hardware advances, such as {IBM}'s Blue Gene and {DE} Shaw's Anton computers. Further, protein modeling has advanced rapidly over 50 years, even slightly faster than Moore's law. We also review an interesting scientific social construct that has arisen around protein modeling: community-wide blind competitions. They have transformed how we test, validate, and improve our computational models of proteins.
{ADVANCESFor} 50 years, two approaches to computer modeling have been mainstays for developing stories about protein molecules and their biological actions. (i) Inferences from structure-property relations: Based on the principle that a protein's action depends on its shape, it is possible to use databases of known proteins to learn about unknown proteins. (ii) Computational molecular physics uses force fields of atom-atom interactions, sampled by molecular dynamics ({MD}), to develop biological action stories that satisfy principles of chemistry and thermodynamics. {CMP} has traditionally been computationally costly, limited to studying only simple actions of small proteins. But {CMP} has recently advanced enormously. (i) Force fields and their corresponding solvent models are now sufficiently accurate at capturing the molecular interactions, and conformational searching and sampling methods are sufficiently fast, that {CMP} is able to model, fairly accurately, protein actions on time scales longer than microseconds, and sometimes milliseconds. So, we are now accessing important biological events, such as protein folding, unbinding, allosteric change, and assembly. (ii) Just as car races do for auto manufacturers, communal blind tests such as protein structure-prediction events are giving protein modelers a shared evaluation venue for improving our methods. {CMP} methods are now competing and often doing quite well. (iii) New methods are harnessing external information—like experimental structural data—to accelerate {CMP}, notably, while preserving proper physics.What are we learning? For one thing, a long-standing hypothesis is that proteins fold by multiple different microscopic routes, a story that is too granular to learn from experiments alone. {CMP} recently affirmed this principle while giving accurate and testable microscopic details, protein by protein. In addition, {CMP} is now contributing to physico-chemical drug design. Structure-based methods of drug discovery have long been able to discern what small-molecule drug candidates might bind to a given target protein and where on the protein they might bind. However, such methods don't reveal some all-important physical properties needed for drug discovery campaigns—the affinities and the on- and off-rates of the ligand binding to the protein. {CMP} is beginning to compute these properties accurately. A third example is shown in the figure. It shows the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2({SARS}-{CoV}-2), the causative agent of today's coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic. A large, hinge-like movement of this sizable protein is the critical action needed for the virus to enter and infect the human cell. The only way to see the details of this motion—to attempt to block it with drugs—is by {CMP}. The figure shows {CMP} simulation results of three dynamical states of this motion.
{OUTLOOKA} cell's behavior is due to the actions of its thousands of different proteins. Every protein has its own story to tell. {CMP} is a granular and principled tool that is able to discover those stories. {CMP} is now being tested and improved through blind communal validations. It is attacking ever larger proteins, exploring increasingly bigger and slower motions, and with ever more accurate physics. We are reaching a physical understanding of biology at the microscopic level as {CMP} reveals causations and forces, step-by-step actions in space and time, conformational distributions along the way, and important physical quantities such as free energies, rates, and equilibrium constants. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6520/eaaz3041/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint {CMP} modeling of {COVID}-19 infecting the human cell.{SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike glycoprotein (green, with its glycan shield in yellow) attaching to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE}2) receptor protein (purple) through its spike receptor-binding domain (red).

Every protein has a story—how it folds, what it binds, its biological actions, and how it misbehaves in aging or disease. Stories are often inferred from a protein’s shape (i.e., its structure). But increasingly, stories are told using computational molecular physics ({CMP}). {CMP} is rooted in the principled physics of driving forces and reveals granular detail of conformational populations in space and time. Recent advances are accessing longer time scales, larger actions, and blind testing, enabling more of biology’s stories to be told in the language of atomistic physics.},

	abstract = {As its width tends to infinity, a deep neural network's behavior under gradient descent can become simplified and predictable (e.g. given by the Neural Tangent Kernel ({NTK})), if it is parametrized appropriately (e.g. the {NTK} parametrization). However, we show that the standard and {NTK} parametrizations of a neural network do not admit infinite-width limits that can learn features, which is crucial for pretraining and transfer learning such as with {BERT}. We propose simple modifications to the standard parametrization to allow for feature learning in the limit. Using the *Tensor Programs* technique, we derive explicit formulas for such limits. On Word2Vec and few-shot learning on Omniglot via {MAML}, two canonical tasks that rely crucially on feature learning, we compute these limits exactly. We find that they outperform both {NTK} baselines and finite-width networks, with the latter approaching the infinite-width feature learning performance as width increases. More generally, we classify a natural space of neural network parametrizations that generalizes standard, {NTK}, and Mean Field parametrizations. We show 1) any parametrization in this space either admits feature learning or has an infinite-width training dynamics given by kernel gradient descent, but not both; 2) any such infinite-width limit can be computed using the Tensor Programs technique.},

However, studies indicate that the performance of these methods should be further improved to effectively solve complex problems in biomedicine and biotechnology. A data representation method can be defined as an algorithm that calculates numerical feature vectors for samples in a dataset, to be later used in quantitative modelling tasks. Data representation learning methods do this by training and using a model that employs statistical and machine/deep learning algorithms. These novel methods mostly take inspiration from the data-driven language models that have yielded ground-breaking improvements in the field of natural language processing. Lately, these learned data representations have been applied to the field of protein informatics and have displayed highly promising results in terms of extracting complex traits of proteins regarding sequence-structure-function relations. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation over protein representation learning methods, by first categorizing and explaining each approach, and then conducting benchmark analyses on; \textit{(i)} inferring semantic similarities between proteins, \textit{(ii)} predicting ontology-based protein functions, and \textit{(iii)} classifying drug target protein families. We examine the advantages and disadvantages of each representation approach over the benchmark results. Finally, we discuss current challenges and suggest future directions. We believe the conclusions of this study will help researchers in applying machine/deep learning-based representation techniques on protein data for various types of predictive tasks. Furthermore, we hope it will demonstrate the potential of machine learning-based data representations for protein science and inspire the development of novel methods/tools to be utilized in the fields of biomedicine and biotechnology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our model is able to complete the optimization in about 30\% fewer steps than pure {BFGS} for molecules starting from perturbed geometries. The new method has similar convergence to {BFGS} when complemented with a line search procedure, but it is much faster since it avoids the multiple gradient evaluations associated with line searches.},

A derivation of the standard free energy of binding forms the basis of this review. This derivation should be useful in formulating novel computational methods for predicting binding affinities. It also permits several important points to be established. For example, it is found that the doubleannihilation method of computing binding energy does not yield the standard free energy of binding, but can be modified to yield this quantity. The derivation also makes it possible to define clearly the changes in translational, rotational, configurational, and solvent entropy upon binding. It is argued that molecular mass has a negligible effect upon the standard free energy of binding for biomolecular systems, and that the cratic entropy defined by Gurney is not a useful concept. In addition, the use of continuum models of the solvent in binding calculations is reviewed, and a formalism is presented for incorporating a limited number of solvent molecules explicitly.},

Herein, we report on the collection, curation, and integration of data from the public data sets that were the source of the {ChemIDplus} database for systemic acute toxicity. These efforts generated the largest publicly available such data set comprising {\textgreater} 80,000 compounds measured against a total of 59 acute systemic toxicity end points.

To the best of our knowledge, prediction models for 36 of the 59 end points have never been published before. Furthermore, our results demonstrated a significantly better performance of the consensus model obtained from three multitask learning approaches that particularly predicted the 29 smaller tasks (less than 300 compounds) better than other models developed in the study.

	abstract = {In many applications of machine learning, certain categories of examples may be underrepresented in the training data, causing systems to underperform on such "few-shot" cases at test time. A common remedy is to perform data augmentation, such as by duplicating underrepresented examples, or heuristically synthesizing new examples. But these remedies often fail to cover the full diversity and complexity of real examples. We propose a data augmentation approach that performs neural Example Extrapolation (Ex2). Given a handful of exemplars sampled from some distribution, Ex2 synthesizes new examples that also belong to the same distribution. The Ex2 model is learned by simulating the example generation procedure on data-rich slices of the data, and it is applied to underrepresented, few-shot slices. We apply Ex2 to a range of language understanding tasks and significantly improve over state-of-the-art methods on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks, including for relation extraction ({FewRel}) and intent classification + slot filling ({SNIPS}).},

	abstract = {We describe an efficient method for the simultaneous solution of all free energies within a relative binding free-energy ({RBFE}) network with cycle closure and experimental/reference constraint conditions using Bennett Acceptance Ratio ({BAR}) and Multistate {BAR} ({MBAR}) analysis. Rather than solving the {BAR} or {MBAR} equations for each transformation independently, the simultaneous solution of all transformations are obtained by performing a constrained minimization of a global objective function. The nonlinear optimization of the objective function is subjected to affine linear constraints that couple the free energies between the network edges. The constraints are used to enforce the closure of thermodynamic cycles within the {RBFE} network, and to enforce an additional set of linear constraint conditions demonstrated here to be subsets of (1 or 2) experimental values. We describe details of the practical implementation of the network {BAR}/{MBAR} procedure, including use of generalized coordinates in the minimization of the free-energy objective function, propagation of bootstrap errors from those coordinates, and performance and memory optimization. In some cases it is found that use of restraints in the optimization is more practical than use of generalized coordinates for enforcing constraint conditions. The fast {BARnet} and {MBARnet} methods are used to analyze the {RBFEs} of six prototypical protein–ligand systems, and it is shown that enforcement of cycle closure conditions reduces the error in the predictions only modestly, and further reduction in errors can be achieved when one or two experimental {RBFEs} are included in the optimization procedure. These methods have been implemented into {FE}-{ToolKit}, a new free-energy analysis toolkit. The {BARnet}/{MBARnet} framework presented here opens the door to new, more efficient and robust free-energy analysis with enhanced predictive capability for drug discovery applications.},

Empirical studies of networks have identified feedback loops, feedforward loops, and several other small structures as "motifs" that occur frequently in real-world networks and may contribute by various mechanisms to important functions these systems. However, the mechanisms are unknown for many of these motifs. We propose to distinguish between "structure motifs" (i.e., graphlets) in networks and "process motifs" (which we define as structured sets of walks) on networks and consider process motifs as building blocks of processes on networks. Using the covariances and correlations in a multivariate Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process on a network as examples, we demonstrate that the distinction between structure motifs and process motifs makes it possible to gain quantitative insights into mechanisms that contribute to important functions of dynamical systems on networks.},

An important ingredient of our proofs is the use of a continuous-time analogue of multiple random walks, which might be of independent interest.

	abstract = {Modern information networks, such as social networks, communication networks, and citation networks, are often characterized by very large sizes and dynamically changing structures. Common solutions to graph mining tasks (e.g., node classification) usually employ an unrestricted sampling-then-mining paradigm to reduce a large network to a manageable size, followed by subsequent mining tasks. However, real-world networks may be unaccessible at once and must be crawled progressively. This can be due to the fact that the size of the network is too large, or some privacy/legal concerns. In this paper, we propose an Active Exploration framework for large graphs, where the goal is to simultaneously carry out network sampling and node labeling in order to build a sampled network from which the trained classifier can have the maximum node classification accuracy. To achieve this goal, we consider a network as a Markov chain and compute the stationary distribution of the nodes by deriving supervised random walks. The stationary distribution helps identify specific nodes to be sampled in the next step, and the labeling process labels the most informative node which in turn strengthens the sampling of the network. To improve the scalability of active exploration for large graphs, we also propose a more efficient multi-seed algorithm that simultaneously runs multiple, parallel exploration processes, and makes joint decisions to determine which nodes are to be sampled and labeled next. The simultaneous, mutually enhanced sampling and labeling processes ensure that the final sampled network contains a maximum number of nodes directly related to the underlying mining tasks. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our active exploration algorithms have much better chance to include target nodes in the sampled networks than baseline methods.},

In this work we provide a novel method for calculating the hitting time for a single random walker as well as the first analytic expression for calculating the hitting time for multiple random walkers, which we denote as the group hitting time. We also provide a closed form solution for calculating the hitting time between specified nodes for both the single and multiple random walker cases. Our results allow for the multiple random walks to be different and, moreover, for the random walks to operate on different subgraphs.

	abstract = {Performing random walks in networks is a fundamental primitive that has found applications in many areas of computer science, including distributed computing. In this article, we focus on the problem of sampling random walks efficiently in a distributed network and its applications. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain random walk samples. All previous algorithms that compute a random walk sample of length ℓ as a subroutine always do so naively, that is, in O(ℓ) rounds. The main contribution of this article is a fast distributed algorithm for performing random walks. We present a sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing random walks whose time complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our algorithm performs a random walk of length ℓ in Õ(√ℓD) rounds (Õ hides polylog n factors where n is the number of nodes in the network) with high probability on an undirected network, where D is the diameter of the network. For small diameter graphs, this is a significant improvement over the naive O(ℓ) bound. Furthermore, our algorithm is optimal within a poly-logarithmic factor as there exists a matching lower bound [Nanongkai et al. 2011]. We further extend our algorithms to efficiently perform k independent random walks in Õ(√{kℓD} + k) rounds. We also show that our algorithm can be applied to speedup the more general Metropolis-Hastings sampling. Our random-walk algorithms can be used to speed up distributed algorithms in applications that use random walks as a subroutine. We present two main applications. First, we give a fast distributed algorithm for computing a random spanning tree ({RST}) in an arbitrary (undirected unweighted) network which runs in Õ(√{mD}) rounds with high probability (m is the number of edges). Our second application is a fast decentralized algorithm for estimating mixing time and related parameters of the underlying network. Our algorithm is fully decentralized and can serve as a building block in the design of topologically-aware networks.},

	abstract = {A random walk on a graph is a process that explores the graph in a random way: at each step the walk is at a vertex of the graph, and at each step it moves to a uniformly selected neighbor of this vertex. Random walks are extremely useful in computer science and in other fields. A very natural problem that was recently raised by Alon, Avin, Koucky, Kozma, Lotker, and Tuttle (though it was implicit in several previous papers) is to analyze the behavior of k independent walks in comparison with the behavior of a single walk. In particular, Alon et al. showed that in various settings (e.g., for expander graphs), k random walks cover the graph (i.e., visit all its nodes), Ω(k)-times faster (in expectation) than a single walk. In other words, in such cases k random walks efficiently “parallelize” a single random walk. Alon et al. also demonstrated that, depending on the specific setting, this “speedup” can vary from logarithmic to exponential in k.In this paper we initiate a more systematic study of multiple random walks. We give lower and upper bounds both on the cover time and on the hitting time (the time it takes to hit one specific node) of multiple random walks. Our study revolves over three alternatives for the starting vertices of the random walks: the worst starting vertices (those who maximize the hitting/cover time), the best starting vertices, and starting vertices selected from the stationary distribution. Among our results, we show that the speedup when starting the walks at the worst vertices cannot be too large - the hitting time cannot improve by more than an O(k) factor and the cover time cannot improve by more than min \{k logn,k 2\} (where n is the number of vertices). These results should be contrasted with the fact that there was no previously known upper-bound on the speedup and that the speedup can even be exponential in k for random starting vertices. Some of these results were independently obtained by Elsässer and Sauerwald ({ICALP} 2009). We further show that for k that is not too large (as a function of various parameters of the graph), the speedup in cover time is O(k) even for walks that start from the best vertices (those that minimize the cover time). As a rather surprising corollary of our theorems, we obtain a new bound which relates the cover time C and the mixing time mix of a graph. Specifically, we show that 𝐶=𝑂(𝑚mix‾‾‾‾√log2𝑛)C=O(mmixlog2⁡n)C=O(m {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mix\}\}{\textbackslash}log {\textasciicircum}2n) (where m is the number of edges).},

(2008) [5] derived several upper bounds on the cover time, which imply a speed-up of Ω(k) for several graphs; however, for many of them, k has to be bounded by O(logn). They also conjectured that, for any 1⩽k⩽n, the speed-up is at most O(k) on any graph. We prove the following main results: •We present a new lower bound on the speed-up that depends on the mixing time. It gives a speed-up of Ω(k) on many graphs, even if k is as large as n.•We prove that the speed-up is O(klogn) on any graph. For a large class of graphs we can also improve this bound to O(k), matching the conjecture of Alon et al.•We determine the order of the speed-up for any value of 1⩽k⩽n on hypercubes, random graphs and degree restricted expanders. For d-dimensional tori with d{\textgreater}2, our bounds are tight up to logarithmic factors.•Our findings also reveal a surprisingly sharp threshold behaviour for certain graphs, e.g., the d-dimensional torus with d{\textgreater}2 and hypercubes: there is a value T such that the speed-up is approximately min\{T,k\} for any 1⩽k⩽n.},

	abstract = {We study properties of multiple random walks on a graph under various assumptions of interaction between the particles. To give precise results, we make the analysis for random regular graphs. The cover time of a random walk on a random r-regular graph was studied in [C. Cooper and A. Frieze, {SIAM} J. Discrete Math., 18 (2005), pp. 728–740], where it was shown with high probability (whp) that for \$r{\textbackslash}geq3\$ the cover time is asymptotic to \${\textbackslash}theta\_r n{\textbackslash}ln n\$, where \${\textbackslash}theta\_r=(r-1)/(r-2)\$. In this paper we prove the following (whp) results, arising from the study of multiple random walks on a random regular graph G. For k independent walks on G, the cover time \$C\_G(k)\$ is asymptotic to \$C\_G/k\$, where \$C\_G\$ is the cover time of a single walk. For most starting positions, the expected number of steps before any of the walks meet is \${\textbackslash}theta\_r n/{\textbackslash}binom\{k\}\{2\}\$. If the walks can communicate when meeting at a vertex, we show that, for most starting positions, the expected time for k walks to broadcast a single piece of information to each other is asymptotic to \${\textbackslash}frac\{2{\textbackslash}ln k\}\{k\}{\textbackslash}theta\_r n\$ as \$k,n{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$. We also establish properties of walks where there are two types of particles, predator and prey, or where particles interact when they meet at a vertex by coalescing or by annihilating each other. For example, the expected extinction time of k explosive particles (k even) tends to \$(2{\textbackslash}ln2){\textbackslash}theta\_r n\$ as \$k{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$. The case of n coalescing particles, where one particle is initially located at each vertex, corresponds to a voter model defined as follows: Initially each vertex has a distinct opinion, and at each step each vertex changes its opinion to that of a random neighbor. The expected time for a unique opinion to emerge is the same as the expected time for all the particles to coalesce, which is asymptotic to \$2{\textbackslash}theta\_r n\$. Combining results from the predator-prey and multiple random walk models allows us to compare expected detection times of all prey in the following scenarios: Both the predator and the prey move randomly, the prey moves randomly and the predators stay fixed, and the predators move randomly and the prey stays fixed. In all cases, with k predators and \${\textbackslash}ell\$ prey the expected detection time is \${\textbackslash}theta\_r H\_\{{\textbackslash}ell\}n/k\$, where \$H\_\{{\textbackslash}ell\}\$ is the \${\textbackslash}ell\$th harmonic number.},

	abstract = {Existing methods to ﬁnd the eigenvalue spectrum (or a reasonable approximation to it) of square matrices can be extended to Stochastic Matrices ({SM}). The matter is more delicate for the Inverse Eigenvalue Problem ({IEP}), which consists in the reconstruction of a matrix from a given eigenvalue spectrum. In this work, we present a simple method to solve a real-valued {IEP} for {SM} by constructing step-by-step the solution matrix through an elementary Markov state disaggregation method named state splitting, and based on a matrix operator. After showing some results on how the splitting operator inﬂuences the steady-state distribution of the Markov chain associated with the {SM}, we demonstrate that the state splitting operator has a fundamental property: when applied to a {SM} A of size n-by-n, it yields a {SM} of size (n+1)-by-(n+1), whose eigenvalue spectrum is equal to that of A, plus an additional eigenvalue belonging to a bounded interval. We use a constructive method to prove that for any spectrum made of real and positive eigenvalues, one can build up an inﬁnite number of {SM} sharing this spectrum. Finally, we present a new suﬃcient condition to test if a given set of real values can be the spectrum of a {SM} constructed by the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4–9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run.},

	abstract = {Efficient, physically-inspired descriptors of the structure and composition of molecules and materials play a key role in the application of machine-learning techniques to atomistic simulations. The proliferation of approaches, as well as the fact that each choice of features can lead to very different behavior depending on how they are used, e.g. by introducing non-linear kernels and non-Euclidean metrics to manipulate them, makes it difficult to objectively compare different methods, and to address fundamental questions on how one feature space is related to another. In this work we introduce a framework to compare different sets of descriptors, and different ways of transforming them by means of metrics and kernels, in terms of the structure of the feature space that they induce. We define diagnostic tools to determine whether alternative feature spaces contain equivalent amounts of information, and whether the common information is substantially distorted when going from one feature space to another. We compare, in particular, representations that are built in terms of n-body correlations of the atom density, quantitatively assessing the information loss associated with the use of low-order features. We also investigate the impact of different choices of basis functions and hyperparameters of the widely used {SOAP} and Behler-Parrinello features, and investigate how the use of non-linear kernels, and of a Wasserstein-type metric, change the structure of the feature space in comparison to a simpler linear feature space.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are a powerful means of understanding conformational changes. However, it is still difficult to simulate biologically relevant time scales without the use of specialized supercomputers. Here, we introduce a goal-oriented sampling method, called fluctuation amplification of specific traits ({FAST}), for extending the capabilities of commodity hardware. This algorithm rapidly searches conformational space for structures with desired properties by balancing trade-offs between focused searches around promising solutions (exploitation) and trying novel solutions (exploration). {FAST} was inspired by the hypothesis that many physical properties have an overall gradient in conformational space, akin to the energetic gradients that are known to guide proteins to their folded states. For example, we expect that transitioning from a conformation with a small solvent-accessible surface area to one with a large surface area will require passing through a series of conformations with steadily increasing surface areas. We demonstrate that such gradients are common through retrospective analysis of existing Markov state models ({MSMs}). Then we design the {FAST} algorithm to exploit these gradients to find structures with desired properties by (1) recognizing and amplifying structural fluctuations along gradients that optimize a selected physical property whenever possible, (2) overcoming barriers that interrupt these overall gradients, and (3) rerouting to discover alternative paths when faced with insurmountable barriers. To test {FAST}, we compare its performance to other methods for three common types of problems: (1) identifying unexpected binding pockets, (2) discovering the preferred paths between specific structures, and (3) folding proteins. Our conservative estimate is that {FAST} outperforms conventional simulations and an adaptive sampling algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. Furthermore, {FAST} yields both the proper thermodynamics and kinetics, allowing for a direct connection with kinetic experiments that is impossible with many other advanced sampling algorithms because they provide only thermodynamic information. Therefore, we expect {FAST} to be of great utility for a wide range of applications.},

              By means of {RNA} interference ({RNAi}), small interfering {RNAs} ({siRNAs}) play important roles in gene function study and drug development. Recently, photolabile {siRNAs} were developed to elucidate the process of gene silencing in terms of space, time and degree through chemical modification of {siRNAs}. We report herein a novel type of photolabile {siRNA} that was synthesized through cyclizing two ends of a single stranded {RNA} with a photocleavable linker. These circular {siRNAs} became more resistant to serum degradation. Using reporter assays of firefly/
              Renilla
              luciferase and {GFP}/{RFP}, the gene silencing activities of caged circular {siRNAs} for both genes were evaluated in {HEK}293 cells. The results indicated that the target genes were successfully photomodulated using these caged circular {siRNAs} that were formed by caged circular antisense guide {RNAs} and their linear complementary sense {RNAs}. Using the caged circular {siRNA} targeting {GFP}, we also successfully achieved photomodulation of {GFP} expression in mice. Upon further optimization, this new type of caged circular {siRNA} is expected to be a promising tool for studying gene therapy.},

	abstract = {We provide an unsupervised adaptive sampling strategy capable of producing μs-timescale molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations of large biosystems using many-body polarizable force fields ({PFF}). The global exploration problem is decomposed into a set of separate {MD} trajectories that can be restarted within a selective process to achieve sufficient phase-space sampling. Accurate statistical properties can be obtained through reweighting. Within this highly parallel setup, the Tinker--{HP} package can be powered by an arbitrary large number of {GPUs} on supercomputers, reducing exploration time from years to days. This approach is used to tackle the urgent modeling problem of the {SARS}--{CoV}--2 Main Protease (Mpro) producing more than 38 μs of all-atom simulations of its apo, ligand-free, dimer using the high-resolution {AMOEBA} {PFF}. A first 15.14 μs simulation (physiological {pH}) is compared to available non--{PFF} long-timescale simulation data. A detailed clustering analysis exhibits striking differences between {FFs}, {AMOEBA} showing a richer conformational space. Focusing on key structural markers related to the oxyanion hole stability, we observe an asymmetry between protomers. One of them appears less structured resembling the experimentally inactive monomer for which a 6 s simulation was performed as a basis of comparison. Results highlight the plasticity of Mpro active site. The C--terminal end of its less structured protomer is shown to oscillate between several states, being able to interact with the other protomer, potentially modulating its activity. Active and distal sites volumes are found to be larger in the most active protomer within our {AMOEBA} simulations compared to non-{PFFs} as additional cryptic pockets are uncovered. A second 17 μs {AMOEBA} simulation is performed with protonated His172 residues mimicking lower {pH}. Data show the protonation impact on the destructuring of the oxyanion loop. We finally analyze the solvation patterns around key histidine residues. The confined {AMOEBA} polarizable water molecules are able to explore a wide range of dipole moments, going beyond bulk values, leading to a water molecule counts consistent with experiment. Results suggest that the use of {PFFs} could be critical in drug discovery to accurately model the complexity of the molecular interactions structuring Mpro.},

Adaptive sampling methods allow a more eﬀective sampling of protein dynamics than standard {MD} simulations. Depending on the restarting strategy, the speed up can be more than 1 order of magnitude. One challenge limiting the utilization of adaptive sampling by domain experts is the relatively high complexity of eﬃciently running adaptive sampling on {HPC} systems.

In addition, users can provide an open loop reference to guide the learning process when more control over the learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identiﬁcation, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

To overcome this bottleneck, we present the {REinforcement} learning based Adaptive {samPling} ({REAP}) algorithm that aims to efficiently sample conformational space by learning the relative importance of each order parameter as it samples the landscape. To achieve this, the algorithm uses concepts from the field of reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, which rewards sampling along important degrees of freedom and disregards others that do not facilitate exploration or exploitation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {REAP} by comparing the sampling to long continuous {MD} simulations and least-counts adaptive sampling on two model landscapes (L-shaped and circular) and realistic systems such as alanine dipeptide and Src kinase. In all four systems, the {REAP} algorithm consistently demonstrates its ability to explore conformational space faster than the other two methods when comparing the expected values of the landscape discovered for a given amount of time. The key advantage of {REAP} is on-the-fly estimation of the importance of collective variables, which makes it particularly useful for systems with limited structural information.},

Due to the long time scales of typical binding kinetics, the atomistic simulation of the ligand traveling from bulk solution into the binding site is still computationally challenging. In this work, we apply a multiscale approach of combined Molecular Dynamics ({MD}) and Brownian Dynamics ({BD}) simulations to investigate association pathway ensembles for the two prominent H1N1 neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Including knowledge of the approximate binding site location allows for the selective confinement of detailed but expensive {MD} simulations and application of less demanding {BD} simulations for the diffusion controlled part of the association pathway. We evaluate a binding criterion based on the residence time of the inhibitor in the binding pocket and compare it to geometric criteria that require prior knowledge about the binding mechanism. The method ranks the association rates of both inhibitors in qualitative agreement with experiment and yields reasonable absolute values depending, however, on the reaction criteria. The simulated association pathway ensembles reveal that, first, ligands are oriented in the electrostatic field of the receptor. Subsequently, a salt bridge is formed between the inhibitor’s carboxyl group and neuraminidase residue Arg368, followed by adopting the native binding mode. Unexpectedly, despite oseltamivir’s higher overall association rate, the rate into the intermediate salt-bridge state was found to be higher for zanamivir. The present methodology is intrinsically parallelizable and, although computationally demanding, allows systematic binding rate calculation on selected sets of potential drug molecules.},

We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor’s extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 Å from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug–receptor binding and unbinding rates.},

	abstract = {The ability to computationally predict protein-small molecule binding affinities with high accuracy would accelerate drug discovery and reduce its cost by eliminating rounds of trial-and-error synthesis and experimental evaluation of candidate ligands. As academic and industrial groups work toward this capability, there is an ongoing need for datasets that can be used to rigorously test new computational methods. Although protein–ligand data are clearly important for this purpose, their size and complexity make it difficult to obtain well-converged results and to troubleshoot computational methods. Host–guest systems offer a valuable alternative class of test cases, as they exemplify noncovalent molecular recognition but are far smaller and simpler. As a consequence, host–guest systems have been part of the prior two rounds of {SAMPL} prediction exercises, and they also figure in the present {SAMPL}5 round. In addition to being blinded, and thus avoiding biases that may arise in retrospective studies, the {SAMPL} challenges have the merit of focusing multiple researchers on a common set of molecular systems, so that methods may be compared and ideas exchanged. The present paper provides an overview of the host–guest component of {SAMPL}5, which centers on three different hosts, two octa-acids and a glycoluril-based molecular clip, and two different sets of guest molecules, in aqueous solution. A range of methods were applied, including electronic structure calculations with implicit solvent models; methods that combine empirical force fields with implicit solvent models; and explicit solvent free energy simulations. The most reliable methods tend to fall in the latter class, consistent with results in prior {SAMPL} rounds, but the level of accuracy is still below that sought for reliable computer-aided drug design. Advances in force field accuracy, modeling of protonation equilibria, electronic structure methods, and solvent models, hold promise for future improvements.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            The high incidence of cross-resistance between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) protease inhibitors ({PIs}) limits their sequential use. This necessitates the development of {PIs} with a high genetic barrier and a broad spectrum of activity against {PI}-resistant {HIV}, such as tipranavir and darunavir ({TMC}114). We performed a surface plasmon resonance-based kinetic study to investigate the impact of {PI} resistance-associated mutations on the protease binding of five {PIs} used clinically: amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, and tipranavir. With wild-type protease, the binding affinity of darunavir was more than 100-fold higher than with the other {PIs}, due to a very slow dissociation rate. Consequently, the dissociative half-life of darunavir was much higher ({\textgreater}240 h) than that of the other {PIs}, including darunavir's structural analogue amprenavir. The influence of protease mutations on the binding kinetics was tested with five multidrug-resistant ({MDR}) proteases derived from clinical isolates harboring 10 to 14 {PI} resistance-associated mutations with a decreased susceptibility to various {PIs}. In general, all {PIs} bound to the {MDR} proteases with lower binding affinities, caused mainly by a faster dissociation rate. For amprenavir, atazanavir, lopinavir, and tipranavir, the decrease in affinity with {MDR} proteases resulted in reduced antiviral activity. For darunavir, however, a nearly 1,000-fold decrease in binding affinity did not translate into a weaker antiviral activity; a further decrease in affinity was required for the reduced antiviral effect. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for darunavir's potent antiviral activity and high genetic barrier to the development of resistance.},

	abstract = {The ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) has resulted in more than 28,000,000 infections and 900,000 deaths worldwide to date. Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ({ACE}2). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the glycosylated {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike’s receptor binding domain ({RBD}), which is responsible for {ACE}2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to {ACE}2 as a result of the {RBD} conformational shift toward the “down” state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein, which may be exploited in the therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the {RBD} that could be harnessed for vaccine development.},

	abstract = {In the last three decades, protein and nucleic acid structure determination and comprehension of the mechanisms, leading to their physiological and pathological functions, have become a cornerstone of biomedical sciences. A deep understanding of the principles governing the fates of cells and tissue at the molecular level has been gained over the years, offering a solid basis for the rational design of drugs aimed at the pharmacological treatment of numerous diseases. Historically, affinity indicators (i.e. Kd and {IC}50/{EC}50) have been assumed to be valid indicators of the in vivo efficacy of a drug. However, recent studies pointed out that the kinetics of the drug–receptor binding process could be as important or even more important than affinity in determining the drug efficacy. This eventually led to a growing interest in the characterisation and prediction of the rate constants of protein–ligand association and dissociation. For instance, a drug with a longer residence time can kinetically select a given receptor over another, even if the affinity for both receptors is comparable, thus increasing its therapeutic index. Therefore, understanding the molecular features underlying binding and unbinding processes is of central interest towards the rational control of drug binding kinetics. In this review, we report the theoretical framework behind protein–ligand association and highlight the latest advances in the experimental and computational approaches exploited to investigate the binding kinetics.},

Using this system, we report, for the first time, direct estimates of kinetics beyond the seconds timescale using simulations of an all-atom {MD} model, with high accuracy and precision. These results only require explicit simulations on the sub-milliseconds timescale and are tested against existing mutagenesis data and our own experimental measurements of the dissociation and association rates. The full kinetic model reveals an overall downhill but rugged binding funnel with multiple pathways. The overall strong binding arises from a variety of conformations with different hydrophobic contact surfaces that interconvert on the milliseconds timescale.},

The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data.

	abstract = {Little is known about the drivers of critically important antibacterial resistance in species with zoonotic potential present on farms (e.g. {CTX}-M β-lactamase-positive Escherichia coli). We collected samples – monthly, between January 2017 and December 2018 - on 53 dairy farms in South West England along with data for 610 variables concerning antibacterial usage, management practices and meteorological factors. We detected E. coli resistant to amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin and tetracycline, respectively, in 2754/4145 (66\%), 263/4145 (6\%), 1475/4145 (36\%) and 2874/4145 (69\%) of all samples from faecally contaminated on-farm and near-farm sites. E. coli positive for {blaCTX}-M were detected in 224/4145 (5.4\%) of samples. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression showed antibacterial dry cow therapeutic choice (including use of cefquinome or framycetin) to be associated with higher odds of {blaCTX}-M positivity. Low average monthly ambient temperature was associated with lower odds of {blaCTX}-M E. coli positivity in samples and with lower odds of finding E. coli resistant to each of the four test antibacterials. This was additional to the effect of temperature on total E. coli density. Furthermore, samples collected close to calves had higher odds of having E. coli resistant to each antibacterial as well as positive for {blaCTX}-M. Samples collected on pastureland had lower odds of having E. coli resistant to amoxicillin or tetracycline as well as lower odds of being positive for {blaCTX}-M.Importance Antibacterial resistance poses a significant threat to human and animal health and global food security. Surveillance for resistance on farms is important for many reasons, including to track the impacts of interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of resistance. In this longitudinal survey of dairy farm antibacterial resistance, we showed that local temperature - as it changes over the course of a year - was associated with the prevalence of antibacterial-resistant E. coli. We also showed that prevalence of resistant E. coli was lower on pastureland and higher in environments inhabited by young animals. These findings have profound implications for routine surveillance and for surveys carried out for research. They provide important evidence that sampling at a single time-point and/or single location on a farm is unlikely to be adequate to accurately determine the status of the farm regarding the presence of samples containing resistant E. coli.},

Focusing on the coupling, we present the free-energy surface ({FES}) of the ligand-binding process for glutamine-binding protein ({GlnBP}) and its ligand, glutamine, in which glutamine binding accompanies large-scale domain closure. All-atom simulations were performed in explicit solvents by multiscale enhanced sampling ({MSES}), which adopts a multicopy and multiscale scheme to achieve enhanced sampling of systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. The structural ensemble derived from the {MSES} simulation yielded the {FES} of the coupling, described in terms of both the ligand’s and protein’s degrees of freedom at atomic resolution, and revealed the tight coupling between the two degrees of freedom. The derived {FES} led to the determination of definite structural states, which suggested the dominant pathways of glutamine binding to {GlnBP}: first, glutamine migrates via diffusion to form a dominant encounter complex with Arg75 on the large domain of {GlnBP}, through strong polar interactions. Subsequently, the closing motion of {GlnBP} occurs to form ligand interactions with the small domain, finally completing the native-specific complex structure. The formation of hydrogen bonds between glutamine and the small domain is considered to be a rate-limiting step, inducing desolvation of the protein–ligand interface to form the specific native complex. The key interactions to attain high specificity for glutamine, the “door keeper” existing between the two domains (Asp10–Lys115) and the “hydrophobic sandwich” formed between the ligand glutamine and Phe13/Phe50, have been successfully mapped on the pathway derived from the {FES}.},

In recent years, atomistic free energy calculations have proven to be a valid tool to complement experiments in characterizing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of protein/ligand interaction. Here, we investigate, through a recently developed metadynamics-based protocol, the unbinding mechanism of an inhibitor of the pharmacologically relevant target p38 {MAP} kinase. We provide a thorough description of the ligand unbinding pathway identifying the most stable binding mode and other thermodynamically relevant poses. From our simulations, we estimated the unbinding rate as koff = 0.020 ± 0.011 s–1. This is in good agreement with the experimental value (koff = 0.14 s–1). Next, we developed a Markov state model that allowed identifying the rate-limiting step of the ligand unbinding process. Our calculations further show that the solvation of the ligand and that of the active site play crucial roles in the unbinding process. This study paves the way to investigations on the unbinding dynamics of more complex p38 inhibitors and other pharmacologically relevant inhibitors in general, demonstrating that metadynamics can be a powerful tool in designing new drugs with engineered binding/unbinding kinetics.},

The molecular determinants of drug–receptor binding kinetics remain poorly understood, however, especially when compared with the well-known factors that affect binding affinity. The rational modulation of kinetics during lead optimization thus remains challenging. We review some of the key factors thought to control drug–receptor binding kinetics at the molecular level — molecular size, conformational fluctuations, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects — and discuss several possible approaches for the rational design of drugs with desired binding kinetics.},

While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importance sampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniques out of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called {OpenPathSampling} ({OPS}) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yet is still extensible. Interfaces to {OpenMM} and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are provided in the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-use transition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling ({TPS}) between reactant and product states and transition interface sampling ({TIS}) and its replica exchange variant ({RETIS}), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling ({MSTIS}, {MISTIS}). In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basic path sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustrate the simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems.},

To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of {WE} simulations: {WESTPA} (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). {WESTPA} scales to thousands of {CPU} cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion.

The first model (model A) yields a free energy of binding based on computed free energy changes in solvated and host-guest complex phases; the second (model B) adds long range dispersion corrections to the previous result; the third (model C) uses an additional standard state correction term to account for the use of distance restraints during the molecular dynamics simulations.

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.},

	title = {Learning Robotic Manipulation through Visual Planning and Acting},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04411},
	abstract = {Planning for robotic manipulation requires reasoning about the changes a robot can affect on objects. When such interactions can be modelled analytically, as in domains with rigid objects, efﬁcient planning algorithms exist. However, in both domestic and industrial domains, the objects of interest can be soft, or deformable, and hard to model analytically. For such cases, we posit that a data-driven modelling approach is more suitable. In recent years, progress in deep generative models has produced methods that learn to ‘imagine’ plausible images from data. Building on the recent Causal {InfoGAN} generative model, in this work we learn to imagine goal-directed object manipulation directly from raw image data of self-supervised interaction of the robot with the object. After learning, given a goal observation of the system, our model can generate an imagined plan – a sequence of images that transition the object into the desired goal. To execute the plan, we use it as a reference trajectory to track with a visual servoing controller, which we also learn from the data as an inverse dynamics model. In a simulated manipulation task, we show that separating the problem into visual planning and visual tracking control is more sample efﬁcient and more interpretable than alternative datadriven approaches. We further demonstrate our approach on learning to imagine and execute in 3 environments, the ﬁnal of which is deformable rope manipulation on a {PR}2 robot.},

	abstract = {The focus of this work is to enumerate the various approaches and algorithms that center around application of reinforcement learning in robotic manipulation tasks. Earlier methods utilized specialized policy representations and human demonstrations to constrict the policy. Such methods worked well with continuous state and policy space of robots but failed to come up with generalized policies. Subsequently, high dimensional non-linear function approximators like neural networks have been used to learn policies from scratch. Several novel and recent approaches have also embedded control policy with eﬃcient perceptual representation using deep learning. This has led to the emergence of a new branch of dynamic robot control system called deep reinforcement learning({DRL}). This work embodies a survey of the most recent algorithms, architectures and their implementations in simulations and real world robotic platforms. The gamut of {DRL} architectures are partitioned into two diﬀerent branches namely, discrete action space algorithms({DAS}) and continuous action space algorithms({CAS}). Further, the {CAS} algorithms are divided into stochastic continuous action space({SCAS}) and deterministic continuous action space({DCAS}) algorithms. Along with elucidating an organisation of the {DRL} algorithms this work also manifests some of the state of the art applications of these approaches in robotic manipulation tasks.},

The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identiﬁcation, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called {AlphaZero}, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). {AlphaZero} managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of {AlphaZero} to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system.
Science, this issue p. 1140; see also pp. 1087 and 1118
The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the {AlphaGo} Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single {AlphaZero} algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, {AlphaZero} convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.
{AlphaZero} teaches itself to play three different board games and beats state-of-the-art programs in each.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI})-based approaches have had indubitable impact across the sciences through the ability to extract relevant information from raw data. Recently, {AI} has also found use in enhancing the efficiency of molecular simulations, wherein {AI} derived slow modes are used to accelerate the simulation in targeted ways. However, while typical fields where {AI} is used are characterized by a plethora of data, molecular simulations, per construction, suffer from limited sampling and thus limited data. As such, the use of {AI} in molecular simulations can suffer from a dangerous situation where the {AI}-optimization could get stuck in spurious regimes, leading to incorrect characterization of the reaction coordinate ({RC}) for the problem at hand. When such an incorrect {RC} is then used to perform additional simulations, one could start to deviate progressively from the ground truth. To deal with this problem of spurious {AI}-solutions, here, we report a novel and automated algorithm using ideas from statistical mechanics. It is based on the notion that a more reliable {AI}-solution will be one that maximizes the timescale separation between slow and fast processes. To learn this timescale separation even from limited data, we use a maximum caliber-based framework. We show the applicability of this automatic protocol for three classic benchmark problems, namely, the conformational dynamics of a model peptide, ligand-unbinding from a protein, and folding/unfolding energy landscape of the C-terminal domain of protein G.

	abstract = {The mapping of chemical space by the enumeration of graphs generates an infinite number of molecules, yet the experimental exploration of known chemical space shows that it appears to become sparser as the molecular weight of the compounds increases. What is needed is a way to explore chemical space that exploits the information encoded in known molecules to give access to unknown chemical space by building on the common conserved structures found in related families of molecules. Molecular assembly theory provides an approach to explore and compare the intrinsic complexity of molecules by the minimum number of steps needed to build up the target graphs, and here we show this can be applied to networks of molecules to explore the assembly properties of common motifs, rather than just focusing on molecules in isolation. This means molecular assembly theory can be used to define a tree of assembly spaces, allowing us to explore the accessible molecules connected to the tree, rather than the entire space of possible molecules. This approach provides a way to map the relationship between the molecules and their common fragments and thus measures the distribution of structural information collectively embedded in the molecules. We apply this approach to prebiotic chemistry, specifically the construction of {RNA}, and a family of opiates and plasticizers, as well as to gene sequences. This analysis allows us to quantify the amount of external information needed to assemble the tree and identify and predict new components in this family of molecules, based on the contingent information in the assembly spaces.},

Here we investigate the interplay of conformational change and ligand-binding kinetics for the serine protease Trypsin and its competitive inhibitor Benzamidine with an extensive set of 150 μs molecular dynamics simulation data, analysed using a Markov state model. Seven metastable conformations with different binding pocket structures are found that interconvert at timescales of tens of microseconds. These conformations differ in their substrate-binding affinities and binding/dissociation rates. For each metastable state, corresponding solved structures of Trypsin mutants or similar serine proteases are contained in the protein data bank. Thus, our wild-type simulations explore a space of conformations that can be individually stabilized by adding ligands or making suitable changes in protein sequence.

Various virtual screening techniques are now being used by both pharmaceutical companies and academic research groups to reduce the cost and time required for the discovery of a potent drug. Despite the rapid advances in these methods, continuous improvements are critical for future drug discovery tools. Advantages presented by structure-based and ligand-based drug design suggest that their complementary use, as well as their integration with experimental routines, has a powerful impact on rational drug design.

	shorttitle = {Ensembler},
	abstract = {The rapidly expanding body of available genomic and protein structural data provides a rich resource for understanding protein dynamics with biomolecular simulation. While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an omics scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. Ensembler takes any set of sequences—from a single sequence to an entire superfamily—and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant {PDB} structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. Ensembler thus automates much of the time-consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics—such as Markov state models ({MSMs})—which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates.

The hallmark of these methods is the use of "bridging" potential energy functions representing \_alchemical\_ intermediate states that cannot exist as real chemical species. The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data. In this paper, we review current best practices for several popular application domains of alchemical free energy calculations, including relative and absolute small molecule binding free energy calculations to biomolecular targets.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting protein–ligand binding affinities and binding modes is a major goal in computational chemistry, but even the prediction of ligand binding modes in proteins poses major challenges. Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation time scales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo ({NCMC}) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this {NCMC} method shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step toward applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding modes of ligands using enhanced sampling ({BLUES}) package which is freely available on {GitHub}.},

We explore chemical reactions involving small symmetric molecules, and argue that in many situations a full quantum treatment of collective nuclear degrees of freedom is essential. Supported by several physical arguments, we conjecture a "Quantum Dynamical Selection" ({QDS}) rule for small symmetric molecules that precludes chemical processes that involve direct transitions from orbitally non-symmetric molecular states. As we propose and discuss, the implications of the Quantum Dynamical Selection rule include: (i) a differential chemical reactivity of para- and ortho-hydrogen, (ii) a mechanism for inducing inter-molecular quantum entanglement of nuclear spins, (iii) a new isotope fractionation mechanism, (iv) a novel explanation of the enhanced chemical activity of "Reactive Oxygen Species", (v) illuminating the importance of ortho-water molecules in modulating the quantum dynamics of liquid water, (vi) providing the critical quantum-to-biochemical linkage in the nuclear spin model of the (putative) quantum brain, among others.},

The kinetic distance can be computed given a model that approximates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (reaction coordinates) of the {MD} Markov operator. Here, we employ the time-lagged independent component analysis ({TICA}). The {TICA} components can be scaled to provide a kinetic map in which the Euclidean distance corresponds to the kinetic distance. As a result, the question of how many {TICA} dimensions should be kept in a dimensionality reduction approach becomes obsolete, and one parameter less needs to be speciﬁed in the kinetic model construction. We demonstrate the approach using {TICA} and Markov state model ({MSM}) analyses for illustrative models, protein conformation dynamics in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and protein-inhibitor association in trypsin and benzamidine. We ﬁnd that the total kinetic variance ({TKV}) is an excellent indicator of model quality and can be used to rank diﬀerent input feature sets.},

	title = {Using metadynamics to build neural network potentials for reactive events: the case of urea decomposition in water},
	abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in aqueous media is very important for its implications in several fields of science, from biology to industrial processes. Modelling these reactions is however difficult when water directly participates in the reaction. Since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system, ab-initio molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state configurations. In this study, we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover a number of novel metastable states and to improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the {pH} solution.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10127},
	abstract = {The ability to make sense of the massive amounts of high-dimensional data generated from molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations is heavily dependent on the knowledge of a low dimensional manifold (known as reaction coordinate or {RC}) that typically distinguishes between relevant metastable states and which captures the relevant slow dynamics of interest. Methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence have been proposed over the years to deal with learning such low-dimensional manifolds, but they are often criticized for a disconnect from more traditional and physically interpretable approaches. To deal with such concerns, in this work, we propose a deep learning based State Predictive Information Bottleneck ({SPIB}) approach to learn the {RC} from high dimensional molecular simulation trajectories. We demonstrate analytically and numerically how the {RC} learnt in this approach is deeply connected to the committor in chemical physics, and can be used to accurately identify transition states. A crucial hyperparameter in this approach is the time-delay, or how far into the future should the algorithm make predictions about. Through careful comparisons for benchmark systems, we demonstrate that this hyperparameter choice gives useful control over how coarse-grained we want the metastable state classification of the system to be. We thus believe that this work represents a step forward in systematic application of deep learning based ideas to molecular simulations in a way that bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and traditional chemical physics.},

A set of experiments using the {USPTO} dataset demonstrates excellent performance and interpretability of the proposed model.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06066},
	abstract = {A fundamental feature of complex biological systems is the ability to form feedback interactions with their environment. A prominent model for studying such interactions is reservoir computing, where learning acts on low-dimensional bottlenecks. Despite the simplicity of this learning scheme, the factors contributing to or hindering the success of training in reservoir networks are in general not well understood. In this work, we study non-linear feedback networks trained to generate a sinusoidal signal, and analyze how learning performance is shaped by the interplay between internal network dynamics and target properties. By performing exact mathematical analysis of linearized networks, we predict that learning performance is maximized when the target is characterized by an optimal, intermediate frequency which monotonically decreases with the strength of the internal reservoir connectivity. At the optimal frequency, the reservoir representation of the target signal is high-dimensional, de-synchronized, and thus maximally robust to noise. We show that our predictions successfully capture the qualitative behaviour of performance in non-linear networks. Moreover, we find that the relationship between internal representations and performance can be further exploited in trained non-linear networks to explain behaviours which do not have a linear counterpart. Our results indicate that a major determinant of learning success is the quality of the internal representation of the target, which in turn is shaped by an interplay between parameters controlling the internal network and those defining the task.},

	abstract = {In multiple time scale molecular dynamics, the use of isokinetic constraints along with massive thermostatting has enabled the adoption of very large integration steps, well beyond the limits imposed by resonance artifacts in standard algorithms. In this work, we present two new contributions to this topic. First, we investigate the velocity distribution and the temperature–kinetic energy relationship associated with the isokinetic Nosé–Hoover family of methods, showing how they depend on the number of thermostats attached to each atomic degree of freedom. Second, we investigate the performance of these methods in the calculation of solvation free energies, the determination of which is often key for understanding the partition of a chemical species among distinct environments. We show how one can extract this property from canonical (constant-{NVT}) simulations and compare the result to experimental data obtained at a specific pressure. Finally, we demonstrate that large time steps can, in fact, be used to improve the efficiency of these calculations and that attaching multiple thermostats per degree of freedom is beneficial for effectively exploring the configurational space of a molecular system.},

But the limitations of {HDI} have become clear in the 21st century, given a growing crisis of climate change and ecological breakdown. {HDI} pays no attention to ecology, and retains an emphasis on high levels of income that – given strong correlations between income and ecological impact – violates sustainability principles. The countries that score highest on the {HDI} also contribute most, in per capita terms, to climate change and other forms of ecological breakdown. In this sense, {HDI} promotes a model of development that is empirically incompatible with ecological stability, and impossible to universalize. In this paper I propose an alternative index that corrects for these problems: the Sustainable Development Index ({SDI}). The {SDI} retains the base formula of the {HDI} but places a sufficiency threshold on per capita income, and divides by two key indicators of ecological impact: {CO}2 emissions and material footprint, both calculated in per capita consumption-based terms and rendered vis-à-vis planetary boundaries. The {SDI} is an indicator of strong sustainability that measures nations’ ecological efficiency in delivering human development.},

This claim is now assumed in national and international policy, including in the Sustainable Development Goals. But empirical evidence on resource use and carbon emissions does not support green growth theory. Examining relevant studies on historical trends and model-based projections, we ﬁnd that: (1) there is no empirical evidence that absolute decoupling from resource use can be achieved on a global scale against a background of continued economic growth, and (2) absolute decoupling from carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid enough to prevent global warming over 1.5°C or 2°C, even under optimistic policy conditions. We conclude that green growth is likely to be a misguided objective, and that policymakers need to look toward alternative strategies.},

Therefore, a variety of analysis frameworks have been introduced in order to distill complex motions into lower-dimensional representations that model the system dynamics. These dynamical models have been developed to optimally approximate the system’s global kinetics. However, the separate aims of optimizing global kinetics and modeling a process of interest diverge when the process of interest is not the slowest process in the system. Here, we introduce deflation into state-of-the-art methods in molecular kinetics in order to preserve the use of variational optimization tools when the slowest dynamical mode is not the same as the one we seek to model and understand. First, we showcase deflation for a simple toy system and introduce the deflated variational approach to Markov processes ({dVAMP}). Using {dVAMP}, we show that nondominant reaction coordinates produced using deflation are more informative than their counterparts generated without deflation. Then, we examine a protein folding system in which the slowest dynamical mode is not folding. Following a {dVAMP} analysis, we show that deflation can be used to obscure this undesired slow process from a kinetic model; in this case, a {VAMPnet}. The incorporation of deflation into current methods opens the door for enhanced sampling strategies and more flexible, targeted model building.},

The {SBM} has now been employed for more than a decade to analyze very different types of networks in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds, including biology and the social sciences. Recently, an analytical expression based on the collapsing of the {SBM} parameters has been proposed, in combination with a sampling procedure that allows the clustering of the vertices and the estimation of the number of clusters to be performed simultaneously. Although the corresponding algorithm can technically accommodate up to 10 000 nodes and millions of edges, the Markov chain, however, tends to exhibit poor mixing properties, that is, low acceptance rates, for large networks. Therefore, the number of clusters tends to be highly overestimated, even for a very large number of samples. In this article, we rely on a similar expression, which we call the integrated complete data log likelihood, and propose a greedy inference algorithm that focuses on maximizing this exact quantity. This algorithm incurs a smaller computational cost than existing inference techniques for the {SBM} and can be employed to analyze large networks (several tens of thousands of nodes and millions of edges) with no convergence problems. Using toy datasets, the algorithm exhibits improvements over existing strategies, both in terms of clustering and model selection.

However, this approach breaks down in frustrated systems and in large protein assemblies, where the number of global metastable states may grow exponentially with the system size.

	abstract = {Efficient sampling of equilibrium states
Molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample equilibrium states, but these methods become computationally expensive for complex systems, where the transition from one equilibrium state to another may only occur through rare events. Noé et al. used neural networks and deep learning to generate distributions of independent soft condensed-matter samples at equilibrium (see the Perspective by Tuckerman). Supervised training is used to construct invertible transformations between the coordinates of the complex system of interest and simple Gaussian coordinates of the same dimensionality. Thus, configurations can be sampled in this simpler coordinate system and then transformed back into the complex one using the correct statistical weighting.

Structured Abstract
{INTRODUCTIONStatistical} mechanics aims to compute the average behavior of physical systems on the basis of their microscopic constituents. For example, what is the probability that a protein will be folded at a given temperature? If we could answer such questions efficiently, then we could not only comprehend the workings of molecules and materials, but we could also design drug molecules and materials with new properties in a principled way.To this end, we need to compute statistics of the equilibrium states of many-body systems. In the protein-folding example, this means to consider each of the astronomically many ways to place all protein atoms in space, to compute the probability of each such “configuration” in the equilibrium ensemble, and then to compare the total probability of unfolded and folded configurations.As enumeration of all configurations is infeasible, one instead must attempt to sample them from their equilibrium distribution. However, we currently have no way to generate equilibrium samples of many-body systems in “one shot.” The main approach is thus to start with one configuration, e.g., the folded protein state, and make tiny changes to it over time, e.g., by using Markov-chain Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics ({MD}). However, these simulations get trapped in metastable (long-lived) states: For example, sampling a single folding or unfolding event with atomistic {MD} may take a year on a supercomputer.
{RATIONALEHere}, we combine deep machine learning and statistical mechanics to develop Boltzmann generators. Boltzmann generators are trained on the energy function of a many-body system and learn to provide unbiased, one-shot samples from its equilibrium state. This is achieved by training an invertible neural network to learn a coordinate transformation from a system’s configurations to a so-called latent space representation, in which the low-energy configurations of different states are close to each other and can be easily sampled. Because of the invertibility, every latent space sample can be back-transformed to a system configuration with high Boltzmann probability (Fig. 1). We then employ statistical mechanics, which offers a rich set of tools for reweighting the distribution generated by the neural network to the Boltzmann distribution.
{RESULTSBoltzmann} generators can be trained to directly generate independent samples of low-energy structures of condensed-matter systems and protein molecules. When initialized with a few structures from different metastable states, Boltzmann generators can generate statistically independent samples from these states and efficiently compute the free-energy differences between them. This capability could be used to compute relative stabilities between different experimental structures of protein or other organic molecules, which is currently a very challenging problem. Boltzmann generators can also learn a notion of “reaction coordinates”: Simple linear interpolations between points in latent space have a high probability of corresponding to physically realistic, low-energy transition pathways. Finally, by using established sampling methods such as Metropolis Monte Carlo in the latent space variables, Boltzmann generators can discover new states and gradually explore state space.
{CONCLUSIONBoltzmann} generators can overcome rare event–sampling problems in many-body systems by learning to generate unbiased equilibrium samples from different metastable states in one shot. They differ conceptually from established enhanced sampling methods, as no reaction coordinates are needed to drive them between metastable states. However, by applying existing sampling methods in the latent spaces learned by Boltzmann generators, a plethora of new opportunities opens up to design efficient sampling methods for many-body systems. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/365/6457/eaaw1147/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Boltzmann generators overcome sampling problems between long-lived states.The Boltzmann generator works as follows: 1.

To compute thermodynamics quantities, the samples are reweighted to the Boltzmann distribution using statistical mechanics methods.
Computing equilibrium states in condensed-matter many-body systems, such as solvated proteins, is a long-standing challenge. Lacking methods for generating statistically independent equilibrium samples in “one shot,” vast computational effort is invested for simulating these systems in small steps, e.g., using molecular dynamics. Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.
By combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, neural networks sample the equilibrium distribution of many-body systems.

	abstract = {Conventional methods for protein structure determination from {NMR} data rely on the ad hoc combination of physical forcefields and experimental data, along with heuristic determination of free parameters such as weight of experimental data relative to a physical forcefield. Recently, a theoretically rigorous approach was developed which treats structure determination as a problem of Bayesian inference. In this case, the forcefields are brought in as a prior distribution in the form of a Boltzmann factor. Due to high computational cost, the approach has been only sparsely applied in practice. Here, we demonstrate that the use of generative probabilistic models instead of physical forcefields in the Bayesian formalism is not only conceptually attractive, but also improves precision and efficiency. Our results open new vistas for the use of sophisticated probabilistic models of biomolecular structure in structure determination from experimental data.},

The European Commission's proposal for a {CAP} post-2020 provides a scope for enhanced sustainability. However, it also allows Member States to choose low-ambition implementation pathways. It therefore remains essential to address citizens' demands for sustainable agriculture and rectify systemic weaknesses in the {CAP}, using the full breadth of available scientific evidence and knowledge. Concerned about current attempts to dilute the environmental ambition of the future {CAP}, and the lack of concrete proposals for improving the {CAP} in the draft of the European Green Deal, we call on the European Parliament, Council and Commission to adopt 10 urgent action points for delivering sustainable food production, biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation.

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization has proven to be a highly effective methodology for the global optimization of unknown, expensive and multimodal functions. The ability to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions which can be queried efficiently, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in "log-space," to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.},

The analysis presented here shows that in such systems, the rate coefficient as a function of energy is not just increasing more slowly than expected, it is actually decreasing. This interpretation of the data provides a constraint on proposed microscopic models, i.e., it requires that any successful model of a reaction with a convex Arrhenius plot should be consistent with the microcanonical rate coefficient being a decreasing function of energy. The implications and limitations of this analysis to interpreting enzyme mechanisms are discussed. This model-independent conclusion has broad applicability to all fields of kinetics, and we also draw attention to an analogy with diffusion in metastable fluids and glasses.},

Ribonuclease, dihydrofolate reductase, chymotrypsin, aspartate aminotransferase, and aspartate transcarbamoylase are considered as specific examples. Typical and maximum rates of conformational changes and catalysis are also discussed, based on results obtained from model systems. The nature and rates of interconversion of the intermediates, along with structural information, can be used as the bases for understanding the incredible catalytic efficiency of enzymes. Potential roles of conformational changes in the catalytic process are discussed in terms of static and environmental effects, and in terms of dynamic coupling within the enzyme−substrate complex.},

	isbn = {978-0-412-21340-3},
	url = {https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780412213403},
	abstract = {The suggestion that quantum-mechanical tunnelling might be a significant factor in some chemical reactions was first made fifty years ago by Hund, very soon after the principles of wave mechanics had been established by de Broglie, Schrodinger and Heisenberg, and similar ideas were put forward during the following thirty years by a number of authors. It was realised from the beginning that such effects would be particularly prominent in reactions involving the movement of protons or hydrogen atoms, and both theoretical and experimental work received a powerful stimulus in the discovery of deuterium in 1932. During the last twenty years theoretical predictions about the tunnel effect have been supported by an increasing body of experimental evidence, derived especially from studies of hydrogen isotope effects. The present book presents an attempt to summarize this evidence and to indicate the main lines of the basic theory. Details of mathematical manipu­ lation are restricted mainly to Chapter 2 and the Appendices, and many readers may prefer to confine themselves to the results obtained. The main emphasis has been on the kinetics of chemical reactions involving the transfer of protons, hydrogen atoms or hydride ions, although Chapter 6 gives an account of the role of the tunnel effect in molecular spectra, and Chapter 7 makes some mention of tunnelling in solid state phenomena, biological processes and the electrolytic discharge of hydrogen. Only passing references have been made to tunnelling by electrons.},

	abstract = {The hydrogen-atom transfer in soybean lipoxygenase-1 ({SLO}) exhibits a large kinetic isotope effect on kcat ({KIE} = 81) near room temperature and a very weak temperature dependence (Eact = 2.1 kcal/mol). These properties are consistent with H· transfer that occurs entirely by a tunneling event. Mutants of {SLO} were prepared, and the temperature dependence of the {KIE} was measured, to test for alterations in the tunneling behavior. All mutants studied exhibit {KIEs} of similar, large magnitude at 30 °C, despite an up to 3 orders of magnitude change in kcat. Eact for two of the mutants (Leu754 → Ala, Leu546 → Ala) is larger than for wild-type ({WT}), and the {KIE} becomes slightly more temperature dependent. In contrast, Ile553 → Ala exhibits kcat and Eact parameters similar to wild-type soybean lipoxygenase-1 ({WT}-{SLO}) for protiated substrate; however, the {KIE} is markedly temperature dependent. The behavior of the former two mutants could reflect increased reorganization energies (λ), but the behavior of the latter mutant is inconsistent with this description. We have invoked a full H· tunneling model (Kuznetsov, A. M.; Ulstrup, J. Can. J. Chem. 1999, 77, 1085−1096) to explain the temperature dependence of the {KIE}, which is indicative of the extent to which distance sampling (gating) modulates hydrogen transfer. {WT}-{SLO} exhibits a very small Eact and a nearly temperature-independent {KIE}, which was modeled as arising from a compressed hydrogen transfer distance with little modulation of the hydrogen transfer distance. The observations on the Leu754 → Ala and Leu546 → Ala mutants were modeled as arising from a slightly less compressed active site with greater modulation of the hydrogen transfer distance by environmental dynamics. Finally, the observed behavior of the Ile553 → Ala mutant indicates a relaxed active site with extensive involvement of gating to facilitate hydrogen transfer. We conclude that {WT}-{SLO} has an active site structure that is well organized to support hydrogen tunneling and that mutations perturb structural elements that support hydrogen tunneling. Modest alterations in active site residues increase λ and/or increase the hydrogen transfer distance, thereby affecting the probability that tunneling can occur. These studies allow the detection and characterization of a protein-gating mode in catalysis.},

	abstract = {A significant contemporary question in enzymology involves the role of protein dynamics and hydrogen tunneling in enhancing enzyme catalyzed reactions. Here, we report a correlation between the donor–acceptor distance ({DAD}) distribution and intrinsic kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}) for the dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) catalyzed reaction. This study compares the nature of the hydride-transfer step for a series of active-site mutants, where the size of a side chain that modulates the {DAD} (I14 in E. coli {DHFR}) is systematically reduced (I14V, I14A, and I14G). The contributions of the {DAD} and its dynamics to the hydride-transfer step were examined by the temperature dependence of intrinsic {KIEs}, hydride-transfer rates, activation parameters, and classical molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. Results are interpreted within the framework of the Marcus-like model where the increase in the temperature dependence of {KIEs} arises as a direct consequence of the deviation of the {DAD} from its distribution in the wild type enzyme. Classical {MD} simulations suggest new populations with larger average {DADs}, as well as broader distributions, and a reduction in the population of the reactive conformers correlated with the decrease in the size of the hydrophobic residue. The more flexible active site in the mutants required more substantial thermally activated motions for effective H-tunneling, consistent with the hypothesis that the role of the hydrophobic side chain of I14 is to restrict the distribution and dynamics of the {DAD} and thus assist the hydride-transfer. These studies establish relationships between the distribution of {DADs}, the hydride-transfer rates, and the {DAD}’s rearrangement toward tunneling-ready states. This structure–function correlation shall assist in the interpretation of the temperature dependence of {KIEs} caused by mutants far from the active site in this and other enzymes, and may apply generally to C–H→C transfer reactions.},

	abstract = {Enzymes play a key role in almost all biological processes, accelerating a variety of metabolic reactions as well as controlling energy transduction, the transcription, and translation of genetic information, and signaling. They possess the remarkable capacity to accelerate reactions by many orders of magnitude compared to their uncatalyzed counterparts, making feasible crucial processes that would otherwise not occur on biologically relevant timescales. Thus, there is broad interest in understanding the catalytic power of enzymes on a molecular level. Several proposals have been put forward to try to explain this phenomenon, and one that has rapidly gained momentum in recent years is the idea that enzyme dynamics somehow contributes to catalysis. This review examines the dynamical proposal in a critical way, considering basically all reasonable definitions, including (but not limited to) such proposed effects as "coupling between conformational and chemical motions," "landscape searches" and "entropy funnels." It is shown that none of these proposed effects have been experimentally demonstrated to contribute to catalysis, nor are they supported by consistent theoretical studies. On the other hand, it is clarified that careful simulation studies have excluded most (if not all) dynamical proposals. This review places significant emphasis on clarifying the role of logical definitions of different catalytic proposals, and on the need for a clear formulation in terms of the assumed potential surface and reaction coordinate. Finally, it is pointed out that electrostatic preorganization actually accounts for the observed catalytic effects of enzymes, through the corresponding changes in the activation free energies.},

Such optima cause distinctly curved Arrhenius plots and have, for example, been observed in several cold-adapted enzymes from psychrophilic species. The two main explanations proposed for this behavior either invoke conformational equilibria with inactive substrate-bound states or postulate diﬀerences in heat capacity between the reactant and transition states. Herein, we analyze the implications of the diﬀerent types of kinetic models in terms of apparent activation enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities, using the catalytic reaction of a cold-adapted α-amylase as a prototypic example. We show that the behavior of these thermodynamic activation parameters is fundamentally diﬀerent between equilibrium and heat capacity models, and in the α-amylase case, computer simulations have shown the former model to be correct. A few other enzyme-catalyzed reactions are also discussed in this context.},

The idea is to synthesize a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. For example, we show that it is possible to compress 60,000 {MNIST} training images into just 10 synthetic distilled images (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few gradient descent steps, given a fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in various initialization settings and with different learning objectives.

Training on much smaller training sets while maintaining nearly the same accuracy would be very beneficial. In the few-shot learning setting, a model must learn a new class given only a small number of samples from that class. One-shot learning is an extreme form of few-shot learning where the model must learn a new class from a single example. We propose the `less than one'-shot learning task where models must learn \$N\$ new classes given only \$M{\textless}N\$ examples and we show that this is achievable with the help of soft labels. We use a soft-label generalization of the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier to explore the intricate decision landscapes that can be created in the `less than one'-shot learning setting. We analyze these decision landscapes to derive theoretical lower bounds for separating \$N\$ classes using \$M{\textless}N\$ soft-label samples and investigate the robustness of the resulting systems.},

They aim at modelling, with edges, the way objects of interest, represented by vertices, are related to each other. Looking for clusters of vertices, also called communities or modules, has appeared to be a powerful approach for capturing the underlying structure of a network. In this context, the Block-Clustering model has been applied on random graphs. The principle of this method is to assume that given the latent structure of a graph, the edges are independent and generated from a parametric distribution. Many {EM}-like strategies have been proposed, in a frequentist setting, to optimize the parameters of the model. Moreover, a criterion, based on an asymptotic approximation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood ({ICL}), has recently been derived to estimate the number of classes in the latent structure. In this paper, we show how the Block-Clustering model can be described in a full Bayesian framework and how the posterior distribution, of all the parameters and latent variables, can be approximated efficiently applying Variational Bayes ({VB}). We also propose a new non-asymptotic Bayesian model selection criterion. Using simulated data sets, we compare our approach to other strategies. We show that our criterion can outperform {ICL}.},

Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale {MD} simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental {NMR} measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-{ILDN}, exhibits considerably better agreement with the {NMR} data. Proteins 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

How- ever, the performance of a Bayesian optimization method very much depends on its exploration strategy, i.e. the choice of acquisition function, and it is not clear a priori which choice will result in superior performance. While portfolio methods provide an effective, principled way of combining a collection of acquisition functions, they are often based on measures of past performance which can be misleading. To address this issue, we introduce the Entropy Search Portfolio ({ESP}): a novel approach to portfolio construction which is motivated by information theoretic considerations. We show that {ESP} outperforms existing portfolio methods on several real and synthetic problems, including geostatistical datasets and simulated control tasks. We not only show that {ESP} is able to offer performance as good as the best, but unknown, acquisition function, but surprisingly it often gives better performance. Finally, over a wide range of conditions we find that {ESP} is robust to the inclusion of poor acquisition functions.},

Leveraging accuracy and speed, these functional forms ﬁnd use in a wide variety of applications from rapid virtual screening to detailed free energy calculations. Traditionally, {MM} potentials have relied on human-curated, inﬂexible, and poorly extensible discrete chemical perception rules (atom types) for applying parameters to molecules or biopolymers, making them difﬁcult to optimize to ﬁt quantum chemical or physical property data. Here, we propose an alternative approach that uses graph nets to perceive chemical environments, producing continuous atom embeddings from which valence and nonbonded parameters can be predicted using a feed-forward neural network. Since all stages are built using smooth functions, the entire process of chemical perception and parameter assignment is differentiable end-to-end with respect to model parameters, allowing new force ﬁelds to be easily constructed, extended, and applied to arbitrary molecules. We show that this approach has the capacity to reproduce legacy atom types and can be ﬁt to {MM} and {QM} energies and forces, among other targets.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen/deuterium exchange ({HDX}) is a powerful technique to investigate protein conformational dynamics at amino acid resolution. Because {HDX} provides a measurement of solvent exposure of backbone hydrogens, ensemble-averaged over potentially slow kinetic processes, it has been challenging to use {HDX} protection factors to refine structural ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. This entails dual challenges: (1) identifying structural observables that best correlate with backbone amide protection from exchange and (2) restraining these observables in molecular simulations to model ensembles consistent with experimental measurements. Here, we make significant progress on both fronts. First, we describe an improved predictor of {HDX} protection factors from structural observables in simulated ensembles, parametrized from ultralong molecular dynamics simulation trajectory data, with a Bayesian inference approach used to retain the full posterior distribution of model parameters. We next present a new method for obtaining simulated ensembles in agreement with experimental {HDX} protection factors, in which molecular simulations are performed at various temperatures and restraint biases and used to construct multiensemble Markov State Models ({MSMs}). Finally, the {BICePs} (Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations) algorithm is then used with our {HDX} protection factor predictor to infer which thermodynamic ensemble agrees best with the experiment and estimate populations of each conformational state in the {MSM}. To illustrate the approach, we use a combination of {HDX} protection factor restraints and chemical shift restraints to model the conformational ensemble of apomyoglobin at {pH} 6. The resulting ensemble agrees well with the experiment and gives insight into the all-atom structure of disordered helices F and H in the absence of heme.},

	abstract = {The human telomeric {DNA} G-quadruplex follows a kinetic partitioning folding mechanism. The underlying folding landscape potentially has many minima separated by high freeenergy barriers. However, using current theoretical models to characterize this complex folding landscape has remained a challenging problem. In this study, by developing a hybrid atomistic structure-based model that merges structural information on the hybrid-1, hybrid-2, and chair-type G-quadruplex topologies, we investigated a kinetic partitioning folding process of human telomeric {DNA} involving three native folds. The model was validated as it reproduced the experimental observation that the hybrid-1 conformation is the major fold and the hybrid-2 conformation is kinetically more accessible. A three-step mechanism was revealed for the formation of the hybrid-1 conformation, while a two-step mechanism was demonstrated for the formation of hybrid-2 and chair-type conformations. Likewise, a class of state in which structures adopted inappropriate combinations of syn/anti guanine nucleotides was found to greatly slow down the folding process. In addition, by employing the {XGBoost} machine learning algorithm, three interatom distances and six dihedral angles were identiﬁed as essential internal coordinates to represent the low-dimensional folding landscape. The strategy of coupling the multibasin model and the machine learning algorithm may be useful to investigate the conformational dynamics of other multistate biomolecules.},

	abstract = {Here, we investigate the association and dissociation mechanisms of a typical intrinsically disordered region ({IDR}), transcriptional activation subdomain of tumor suppressor protein p53 ({TAD}-p53), with murine double-minute clone 2 protein ({MDM}2). Using a combination of cycles of association and dissociation parallel cascade molecular dynamics, multiple standard molecular dynamics ({MD}), and the Markov state model, we were successful in obtaining the lowest free energy structure of the {MDM}2/{TAD}-p53 complex as the structure closest to the crystal structure without prior knowledge of the crystal structure. This method also reproduced the experimentally measured standard binding free energy, and the association and dissociation rate constants, requiring only an accumulated {MD} simulation cost of 11.675 μs even though that actual dissociation occurs on the order of seconds. We identified few complex intermediates with similar free energies; yet {TAD}-p53 first binds {MDM}2 as the second lowest free energy intermediate kinetically with {\textgreater}90\% of the flux, adopting a conformation similar to that of one of these few intermediates in its monomeric state. Even though the mechanism of the first step has a conformational-selection-type aspect, the second step shows induced-fit-like features and occurs as concomitant dehydration of the interface, side-chain π–π stacking, and main-chain hydrogen-bond formation to complete binding as an α-helix. In addition, dehydration is a key process for the final relaxation process around the complex interface. These results demonstrate that {TAD}-p53 kinetically selects its initial binding form and then relaxes to complete the binding.},

	abstract = {The transcriptional adaptor zinc-binding 1 ({TAZ}1) domain of the transcriptional coactivator {CBP}/P300 and two disordered peptides, {HIF}-1α and {CITED}2, form a delicate protein switch that regulates cellular hypoxic response. In hypoxia, {HIF}-1α binds {TAZ}1 to control the transcription of adaptive genes critical for the recovery from hypoxic stress. {CITED}2 acts as the negative feedback regulator to rapidly displace {HIF}-1α and efficiently attenuate the hypoxic response. Though {CITED}2 and {HIF}-1α have the same dissociation constant (Kd = 10 {nM}) in their binary complexes with {TAZ}1, {CITED}2 is much more competitive than {HIF}-1α upon binding the same target {TAZ}1 in ternary (Berlow et al. Nature 2017, 543, 447−451). Here we demonstrate that a simple coarse-grained model can recapitulate this negative allosteric effect and provide detailed physical insights into the displacement mechanism. We find that long-range electrostatic forces are essential for the efficient displacement of {HIF}-1α by {CITED}2. The strong electrostatic interactions between {CITED}2 and {TAZ}1, along with the unique binding mode, make {CITED}2 much more competitive than {HIF}-1α in binding {TAZ}1.},

Their soluble isoforms, functioning as decoy receptors, contain only the ectodomain. Whether the ectodomains of cytokine receptors at the membrane exhibit different conformational dynamics from their soluble forms is unknown. Using Stimulation-2 ({ST}2) as an example, we performed microsecond molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations to study the conformational dynamics of the soluble and the membrane-bound {ST}2 ({sST}2 and {ST}2). Combined use of accelerated and conventional {MD} simulations enabled extensive sampling of the conformational space of {sST}2 for comparison with {ST}2. Using the interdomain loop conformation as the reaction coordinate, we built a Markov State Model to determine the slowest implied timescale of the conformational transition in {sST}2 and {ST}2. We found that the ectodomain of {ST}2 undergoes slower conformational relaxation but exhibits a faster rate of conformational transition in a more restricted conformational space than {sST}2. Analyses of the relaxed conformations of {ST}2 further suggest important contributions of interdomain salt-bridge interactions to the stabilization of different {ST}2 conformations. Our study elucidates differential conformational properties between {sST}2 and {ST}2 that may be exploited for devising strategies to selectively target each isoform.},

	abstract = {Methadone is a synthetic opioid agonist with notoriously unique properties, such as lower abuse liability and induced relief of withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings, despite acting on the same opioid receptors triggered by classic opioids—in particular the µ-opioid receptor ({MOR}). Its distinct pharmacologic properties, which have recently been attributed to the preferential activation of β-arrestin over G proteins, make methadone a standard-of-care maintenance medication for opioid addiction. Although a recent biophysical study suggests that methadone stabilizes different {MOR} active conformations from those stabilized by classic opioid drugs or G protein–biased agonists, how this drug modulates the conformational equilibrium of {MOR} and what specific active conformation of the receptor it stabilizes are unknown. Here, we report the results of submillisecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics simulations of a predicted methadone-bound {MOR} complex and compare them with analogous data obtained for the classic opioid morphine and the G protein–biased ligand {TRV}130. The model, which is supported by existing experimental data, is analyzed using Markov state models and transfer entropy analysis to provide testable hypotheses of methadone-specific conformational dynamics and activation kinetics of {MOR}.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions in both industrialized and developing countries. Although methadone maintenance treatment represents an effective therapeutic approach for opioid addiction, it is not as widely used as needed. In this study, we contribute an atomic-level understanding of how methadone exerts its unique function in pursuit of more accessible treatments for opioid addiction. In particular, we present details of a methadone-specific active conformation of the µ-opioid receptor that has thus far eluded experimental structural characterization.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of water uptake and release by single micrometre-sized aqueous sucrose particles. The experiments were performed in an electrodynamic balance where the particles can be stored contact-free in a temperature and humidity controlled chamber for several days. Aqueous sucrose particles react to a change in ambient humidity by absorbing/desorbing water from the gas phase. This water absorption (desorption) results in an increasing (decreasing) droplet size and a decreasing (increasing) solute concentration. Optical techniques were employed to follow minute changes of the droplet's size, with a sensitivity of 0.2 nm, as a result of changes in temperature or humidity. We exposed several particles either to humidity cycles (between ∼2\% and 90\%) at 291 K or to constant relative humidity and temperature conditions over long periods of time (up to several days) at temperatures ranging from 203 to 291 K. In doing so, a retarded water uptake and release at low relative humidities and/or low temperatures was observed. Under the conditions studied here, the kinetics of this water absorption/desorption process is controlled entirely by liquid-phase diffusion of water molecules. Hence, it is possible to derive the translational diffusion coefficient of water molecules, {DH}2O, from these data by simulating the growth or shrinkage of a particle with a liquid-phase diffusion model. Values for {DH}2O-values as low as 10−24 m2 s−1 are determined using data at temperatures down to 203 K deep in the glassy state. From the experiment and modelling we can infer strong concentration gradients within a single particle including a glassy skin in the outer shells of the particle. Such glassy skins practically isolate the liquid core of a particle from the surrounding gas phase, resulting in extremely long equilibration times for such particles, caused by the strongly non-linear relationship between concentration and {DH}2O. We present a new parameterization of {DH}2O that facilitates describing the stability of aqueous food and pharmaceutical formulations in the glassy state, the processing of amorphous aerosol particles in spray-drying technology, and the suppression of heterogeneous chemical reactions in glassy atmospheric aerosol particles.},

This review will discuss the extent to which it is possible to understand and predict their behavior during processing and storage, on the basis of glass transition temperature values (Tg) and phenomena related to glass transition. Two main conclusions are provisionally proposed. Firstly, glass transition cannot be considered as an absolute threshold for molecular mobility. Transport of water and other small molecules takes place even in the glassy state at a significant rate, resulting in effective exchange of water in multi-domains foods or sensitivity to oxidation of encapsulated materials. Texture properties (crispness) also appear to be greatly affected by sub-Tg relaxations and aging below Tg. Secondly, glass transition is only one among the various factors controlling the kinetics of evolution of products during storage and processing. For processes such as collapse, caking, crystallization, and operations like drying, extrusion, flaking, Tg data and {WLF} kinetics have good predictive value as regards the effects of temperature and water content. On the contrary, chemical/biochemical reactions are frequently observed at temperature below Tg, albeit at a reduced rate, and {WLF} kinetics may be obscured by other factors.},

The {ATB} has several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The {ATB} also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force field topology compatible with a specific {GROMOS} parameter set ({GROMOS} 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force field parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.},

The calculations were performed using a fully automated protocol that incorporated a dynamic analysis of the convergence and integration error in the selection of intermediate points. The system has been designed and implemented such that hydration free enthalpies can be obtained without manual intervention following the submission of a molecule to the {ATB}. The overall average unsigned error ({AUE}) using {ATB} 2.0 topologies for the complete set of 214 molecules was 6.7 {kJ}/mol and for molecules within the {SAMPL}4 7.5 {kJ}/mol. The root mean square error ({RMSE}) was 9.5 and 10.0 {kJ}/mol respectively. However, for molecules containing functional groups that form part of the main {GROMOS} force field the {AUE} was 3.4 {kJ}/mol and the {RMSE} was 4.0 {kJ}/mol.

In this study we first compare equilibration timescales estimated by three different models for diffusion through aerosol particles to assess any sensitivity to choice of model framework. Equilibration times for diffusion coefficients with varying dependencies on composition are compared for the first time. We show that even under large changes in the saturation ratio of a semi-volatile component (\textit{e}$_{\textrm{s}}$) of 1–90 \% predicted equilibration timescales are in agreement, including when diffusion coefficients vary with composition. For condensing water and a diffusion coefficient dependent on composition, a plasticising effect is observed, leading to a decreased estimated equilibration time with increasing final \textit{e}$_{\textrm{s}}$. Above 60 \% final \textit{e}$_{\textrm{s}}$ maximum equilibration times of around 1 s are estimated for comparatively large particles (10 µm) containing a relatively low diffusivity component (1 × 10$^{\textrm{−25}}$ m$^{\textrm{2}}$ s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ in pure form). This, as well as other results here, questions whether particle-phase diffusion through water-soluble particles can limit hygroscopic growth in the ambient atmosphere. In the second part of this study, we explore sensitivities associated with the use of particle radius measurements to infer diffusion coefficient dependencies on composition using a diffusion model. Given quantified similarities between models used in this study, our results confirm considerations that must be taken into account when designing such experiments. Although quantitative agreement of equilibration timescales between models is found, further work is necessary to determine their suitability for assessing atmospheric impacts, such as their inclusion in polydisperse aerosol simulations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Evaporation studies of single aqueous sucrose aerosol particles as a function of relative humidity ({RH}) are presented for coarse and fine mode particles down into the submicron size range (600 nm {\textless} r {\textless} 3.0 μm). These sucrose particles serve as a proxy for biogenic secondary organic aerosols that have been shown to exist, under ambient conditions, in an ultraviscous glassy state, which can affect the kinetics of water mass transport within the bulk phase and hinder particle response to changes in the gas phase water content. A counter-propagating Bessel beams ({CPBBs}) optical trapping setup is employed to monitor the real-time change in the particle radius with {RH} decreasing from 75\% to 5\%. The slow-down of the size change upon each {RH} step and the deviation from the theoretical equilibrium hygroscopic growth curve indicate the onset of glassy behavior in the {RH} range of 10–40\%. Size-dependent effects were not observed within the uncertainty of the measurements. The influence of the drying time below the glass transition {RH} on the timescale of subsequent water condensation and re-equilibration for sucrose particles is explored by optical tweezers measurements of micron-sized particles (3 μm {\textless} r {\textless} 6 μm). The timescale for water condensation and re-equilibration is shown to increase with increasing drying time, i.e. the time over which a viscous particle is dried below 5\% {RH}. These studies demonstrate the importance of the history of the particle conditioning on subsequent water condensation and re-equilibration dynamics of ultraviscous and glassy aerosol particles.},

The powders were made by freeze drying and the low molecular weight sugars (glucose, galactose and fructose) were made as mixtures with lactose. The blow test was used to measure the cohesiveness of the different powders with respect to time while the powders were exposed to a constant temperature and relative humidity environment. It was found that the rate of change of cohesiveness of these powders was directly related to the amount that the glass transition temperature (Tg) was exceeded by (T−Tg). That is, cohesion was related to the combined effect of temperature and moisture and not the individual temperature, water activity or moisture content of the powder. This work confirms that the mechanism for sticking and caking of amorphous sugars is through the phase change of the amorphous sugar from a glass to a rubber at temperatures above the glass transition temperature. Furthermore, it confirms that the rate of cohesiveness development is proportional to the T−Tg value, that is, the greater the temperature above the Tg, the quicker the powders will develop liquid bridges which may result in caking.},

There was also good agreement for the solubility, freezing, and glass transition curves. However, there was no general agreement on the glass transition temperature of pure trehalose.

In order to understand the role of aerosols in often complex environments, it is necessary to probe the particles in situ and without perturbation. Sampling followed by end-of-line analysis can lead to perturbations in particle composition, morphology and size, particularly when analysing liquid aerosol droplets containing volatile components. Optical spectroscopy can provide a strategy for the direct assessment of particle size, composition and phase. We review here the application of linear and non-linear Raman spectroscopies in the characterization of liquid aerosol droplets. Spontaneous Raman scattering can allow the unambiguous identification of chemical components and the determination of droplet composition. Stimulated Raman spectroscopy can allow the determination of droplet size with nanometre accuracy and can allow the characterization of near-surface composition. When combined, the mixing state and homogeneity in droplet composition can be investigated. We highlight some applications of these spectroscopic techniques in studies of the kinetics of particle transformation, the equilibrium composition of aqueous aerosol droplets, and the coagulation and mixing state of organic and aqueous aerosol components. Specifically, we examine the heat and mass transfer accompanying the evaporation of volatile components from liquid droplets, the equilibrium size of aqueous/sodium chloride droplets with varying relative humidity, and the mixing of the immiscible decane and water components during droplet coagulation. We conclude by considering the potential of these techniques for improving our understanding of aerosol properties and processes.},

Using this algorithm, we analyze two large sets of cavity-enhanced Raman spectra from optically trapped aerosol particles. The speed of the algorithm allows for best fits to be found in real time.

	abstract = {The use of optical trapping techniques to manipulate probe particles for performing micro-rheological measurements on a surrounding fluid is well-established. Here, we review recent advances made in the use of optical trapping to probe the rheological properties of trapped particles themselves. In particular, we review observations of the continuous transition from liquid to solid-like viscosity of sub-picolitre supersaturated solution aerosol droplets using optical trapping techniques. Direct measurements of the viscosity of the particle bulk are derived from the damped oscillations in shape following coalescence of two particles, a consequence of the interplay between viscous and surface forces and the capillary driven relaxation of the approximately spheroidal composite particle. Holographic optical tweezers provide a facile method for the manipulation of arrays of particles allowing coalescence to be controllably induced between two micron-sized aerosol particles. The optical forces, while sufficiently strong to confine the composite particle, are several orders of magnitude weaker than the capillary forces driving relaxation. Light, elastically back-scattered by the particle, is recorded with sub-100 ns resolution allowing measurements of fast relaxation (low viscosity) dynamics, while the brightfield image can be used to monitor the shape relaxation extending to times in excess of 1000 s. For the slowest relaxation dynamics studied (particles with the highest viscosity) the presence and line shape of whispering gallery modes in the cavity enhanced Raman spectrum can be used to infer the relaxation time while serving the dual purpose of allowing the droplet size and refractive index to be measured with accuracies of ±0.025\% and ±0.1\%, respectively. The time constant for the damped relaxation can be used to infer the bulk viscosity, spanning from the dilute solution limit to a value approaching that of a glass, typically considered to be {\textgreater}1012 Pa s, whilst the frequencies of the normal modes of the oscillations of the particle can be used to infer surface properties. We will review the use of optical tweezers for studying the viscosity of aerosol particles and discuss the potential use of this micro-rheological tool for probing the fundamental concepts of phase, thermodynamic equilibrium and metastability.},

	abstract = {For the first time, a measurement of the viscosity of microparticles composed of Newtonian fluids has been made over a range of 12 orders of magnitude (10−3 to 109 Pa s), extending from dilute aqueous solutions to the solid-like behaviour expected on approaching a glass transition. Using holographic optical tweezers to induce coalescence between two aerosol particles (volume {\textless}500 femtolitres), we observe the composite particle relax to a sphere over a timescale from 10−7 to 105 s, dependent on viscosity. The damped oscillations in shape illustrate the interplay of surface capillary forces and bulk fluid flow as the relaxation progresses. Viscosity values estimated from the extrapolation of measurements from macroscopic binary aqueous solutions of sucrose are shown to diverge from the microparticle measurements by as much as five orders of magnitude in the limit of ultrahigh solute supersaturation and viscosity. This is shown to be a consequence of the sensitivity of the viscosity to the composition of the particles, specifically the water content, and the often incorrect compositional dependence on water activity that are assumed to characterise aerosols and amorphous phases under dry conditions. For ternary mixtures of sodium chloride, sucrose and water, the measured viscosities similarly diverge from model predictions by up to three orders of magnitude. The Stokes–Einstein treatment for relating the diffusivity of water in sucrose droplets to the particle viscosity is found to depart from the measured viscosities by more than one order of magnitude when the viscosity exceeds 10 Pa s and up to six orders of magnitude at the highest viscosities accessed. Coalescence is shown to proceed with unit efficiency even up to the highest accessible viscosity. These measurements provide the first comprehensive account of the change in a material property accompanying a transition from a dilute solution to an amorphous semi-solid state using aerosol particles to probe the change in rheological properties.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Chemical composition, size distributions, and degree of oligomerization of secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) from α-pinene (C10H16) ozonolysis were investigated for low-temperature conditions (223K). Two types of experiments were performed using two simulation chambers at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology: the Aerosol Preparation and Characterization ({APC}) chamber, and the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere ({AIDA}) chamber. Experiment type 1 simulated {SOA} formation at upper tropospheric conditions: {SOA} was generated in the {AIDA} chamber directly at 223K at 61\% relative humidity ({RH}; experiment termed “cold humid”, {CH}) and for comparison at 6\% {RH} (experiment termed “cold dry”, {CD}) conditions. Experiment type 2 simulated {SOA} uplifting: {SOA} was formed in the {APC} chamber at room temperature (296K) and {\textless}1\% {RH} (experiment termed “warm dry”, {WD}) or 21\% {RH} (experiment termed “warm humid”, {WH}) conditions, and then partially transferred to the {AIDA} chamber kept at 223K, and 61\% {RH} ({WDtoCH}) or 30\% {RH} ({WHtoCH}), respectively. Precursor concentrations varied between 0.7 and 2.2ppm α-pinene, and between 2.3 and 1.8ppm ozone for type 1 and type 2 experiments, respectively. Among other instrumentation, a chemical ionization mass spectrometer ({CIMS}) coupled to a filter inlet for gases and aerosols ({FIGAERO}), deploying I− as reagent ion, was used for {SOA} chemical composition analysis. For type 1 experiments with lower α-pinene concentrations and cold {SOA} formation temperature (223K), smaller particles of 100–300nm vacuum aerodynamic diameter (dva) and higher mass fractions ({\textgreater}40\%) of adducts (molecules with more than 10 carbon atoms) of α-pinene oxidation products were observed. For type 2 experiments with higher α-pinene concentrations and warm {SOA} formation temperature (296K), larger particles (∼500nm dva) with smaller mass fractions of adducts ({\textless}35\%) were produced. We also observed differences (up to 20∘C) in maximum desorption temperature (Tmax) of individual compounds desorbing from the particles deposited on the {FIGAERO} Teflon filter for different experiments, indicating that Tmax is not purely a function of a compound's vapor pressure or volatility, but is also influenced by diffusion limitations within the particles (particle viscosity), interactions between particles deposited on the filter (particle matrix), and/or particle mass on the filter. Highest Tmax were observed for {SOA} under dry conditions and with higher adduct mass fraction; lowest Tmax were observed for {SOA} under humid conditions and with lower adduct mass fraction. The observations indicate that particle viscosity may be influenced by intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding between oligomers, and particle water uptake, even under such low-temperature conditions. Our results suggest that particle physicochemical properties such as viscosity and oligomer content mutually influence each other, and that variation in Tmax of particle desorptions may have implications for particle viscosity and particle matrix effects. The differences in particle physicochemical properties observed between our different experiments demonstrate the importance of taking experimental conditions into consideration when interpreting data from laboratory studies or using them as input in climate models. ]]{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Roles of water in the formation of secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) from the irradiations of toluene-{NO}2 and isoprene-{NO}2 were investigated in a smog chamber. Experimental results show that the yield of {SOA} from toluene almost doubled as relative humidity increased from 5 to 85 \%, whereas the yield of {SOA} from isoprene under humid conditions decreased by 2.6 times as compared to that under dry conditions. The distinct difference of {RH} effects on {SOA} formation from toluene and isoprene is well explained with our experiments and model simulations. The increased {SOA} from humid toluene-{NO}2 irradiations is mainly contributed by O–H-containing products such as polyalcohols formed from aqueous reactions. The major chemical components of {SOA} in isoprene-{NO}2 irradiations are oligomers formed from the gas phase. {SOA} formation from isoprene-{NO}2 irradiations is controlled by stable Criegee intermediates ({SCIs}) that are greatly influenced by water. As a result, high {RH} can obstruct the oligomerization reaction of {SCIs} to form {SOA}.},

	abstract = {A model has been developed to simulate the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) and was tested against data produced in a Potential Aerosol Mass ({PAM}) flow reactor and a large environmental chamber. The model framework is based on the two-dimensional volatility basis set approach (2D-{VBS}), in which {SOA} oxidation products in the model are distributed on the 2-D space of effective saturation concentration (Ci*) and oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O : C). The modeled organic aerosol mass concentrations ({COA}) and O : C agree with laboratory measurements within estimated uncertainties. However, while both measured and modeled O : C increase with increasing {OH} exposure as expected, the increase of modeled O : C is rapid at low {OH} exposure and then slows as {OH} exposure increases while the increase of measured O : C is initially slow and then accelerates as {OH} exposure increases. A global sensitivity analysis indicates that modeled {COA} values are most sensitive to the assumed values for the number of Ci* bins, the heterogeneous {OH} reaction rate coefficient, and the yield of first-generation products. Modeled {SOA} O : C values are most sensitive to the assumed O : C of first-generation oxidation products, the number of Ci* bins, the heterogeneous {OH} reaction rate coefficient, and the number of O : C bins. All these sensitivities vary as a function of {OH} exposure. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the 2D-{VBS} model framework may require modifications to resolve discrepancies between modeled and measured O : C as a function of {OH} exposure.},

Molecular hopping prevails over viscous flow when the probe is small and the temperature is low. Our theory generalizes the Stokes-Einstein relation and fits the experimental data remarkably well.},

	doi = {10.5194/acp-11-4739-2011},
	abstract = {The influence of glassy states and highly viscous solution phases on the timescale of aerosol particle equilibration with water vapour is examined. In particular, the kinetics of mass transfer of water between the condensed and gas phases has been studied for sucrose solution droplets under conditions above and below the glass transition relative humidity ({RH}). Above the glass transition, sucrose droplets are shown to equilibrate on a timescale comparable to the change in {RH}. Below the glass transition, the timescale for mass transfer is shown to be extremely slow, with particles remaining in a state of disequilibrium even after timescales of more than 10 000 s. A phenomenological approach for quantifying the time response of particle size is used to illustrate the influence of the glassy aerosol state on the kinetics of mass transfer of water: the time is estimated for the droplet to reach the halfway point from an initial state towards a disequilibrium state at which the rate of size change decreases below 1 nm every 10 000 s. This half-time increases above 1000 s once the particle can be assumed to have formed a glass. The measurements are shown to be consistent with kinetic simulations of the slow diffusion of water within the particle bulk. When increasing the {RH} from below to above the glass transition, a particle can return to equilibrium with the gas phase on a timescale of 10's to 100's of seconds, once again forming a solution droplet. This is considerably shorter than the timescale for the size change of the particle when glassy and suggests that the dissolution of the glassy core can proceed rapidly, at least at room temperature. Similar behaviour in the slowing of the mass transfer rate below the glass transition {RH} is observed for binary aqueous raffinose solution droplets. Mixed component droplets of sucrose/sodium chloride/water also show slow equilibration at low {RH}, illustrating the importance of understanding the role of the bulk solution viscosity on the rate of mass transfer with the gas phase, even under conditions that may not lead to the formation of a glass.},

	abstract = {The chemical composition of carbonaceous aerosols collected during the {LBA}-{SMOCC} field experiment, conducted in Rondonia, Brazil, in 2002 during the transition from the dry to the wet season, was investigated by a suite of state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The period of most intense biomass burning was characterized by high concentrations of submicron particles rich in carbonaceous material and water-soluble organic compounds ({WSOC}). At the onset of the rainy period, submicron total carbon ({TC}) concentrations decreased by about 20 times. In contrast, the concentration of supermicron {TC} was fairly constant throughout the experiment, pointing to a constant emission of coarse particles from the natural background. About 6 - 8\% of {TC} ( 9 - 11\% of {WSOC}) was speciated at the molecular level by {GC}-{MS} and liquid chromatography. Polyhydroxylated compounds, aliphatic and aromatic acids were the main classes of compounds accounted for by individual compound analysis. Functional group analysis by proton {NMR} and chromatographic separation on ion-exchange columns allowed characterization of ca. 50 - 90\% of {WSOC} into broad chemical classes (neutral species/light acids/humic-like substances). In spite of the significant change in the chemical composition of tracer compounds from the dry to the wet period, the functional groups and the general chemical classes of {WSOC} changed only to a small extent. Model compounds representing size-resolved {WSOC} chemical composition for the different periods of the campaign are then proposed in this paper, based on the chemical characterization by both individual compound analysis and functional group analysis deployed during the {LBA}-{SMOCC} experiment. Model compounds reproduce quantitatively the average chemical structure of {WSOC} and can be used as best-guess surrogates in microphysical models involving organic aerosol particles over tropical areas affected by biomass burning.},

The review provides concepts and a theoretical framework for particle design calculations. It reviews experimental research into parameters that influence particle formation. A classification based on dimensionless numbers is presented that can be used to estimate how excipient properties in combination with process parameters influence the morphology of the engineered particles.

	abstract = {Field measurements indicating that atmospheric secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) particles can be present in a highly viscous, glassy state have spurred numerous studies addressing low diffusivities of water in glassy aerosols. The focus of these studies is on kinetic limitations of hygroscopic growth and the plasticizing effect of water. In contrast, much less is known about diffusion limitations of organic molecules and oxidants in viscous matrices. These may affect atmospheric chemistry and gas–particle partitioning of complex mixtures with constituents of different volatility. In this study, we quantify the diffusivity of a volatile organic in a viscous matrix. Evaporation of single particles generated from an aqueous solution of sucrose and small amounts of volatile tetraethylene glycol ({PEG}-4) is investigated in an electrodynamic balance at controlled relative humidity ({RH}) and temperature. The evaporative loss of {PEG}-4 as determined by Mie resonance spectroscopy is used in conjunction with a radially resolved diffusion model to retrieve translational diffusion coefficients of {PEG}-4. Comparison of the experimentally derived diffusivities with viscosity estimates for the ternary system reveals a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relationship, which has often been invoked to infer diffusivity from viscosity. The evaporation of {PEG}-4 shows pronounced {RH} and temperature dependencies and is severely depressed for {RH} ≲ 30 \%, corresponding to diffusivities {\textless} 10−14 cm2 s−1 at temperatures {\textless} 15 °C. The temperature dependence is strong, suggesting a diffusion activation energy of about 300 {kJ} mol−1. We conclude that atmospheric volatile organic compounds can be subject to severe diffusion limitations in viscous organic aerosol particles. This may enable an important long-range transport mechanism for organic material, including pollutant molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}).},

The resulting products consisted of smooth spheres with a volume median diameter of 2.2-5.5 microm, and narrow size distributions. The investigation was performed in pilot scale of sufficient size to draw general conclusions and make some recommendations. It has been shown that the size of particles is decreased when the feed concentration is decreased, the nozzle gas/feed flow mass ratio increased, and the droplet size decreased. The collection efficiency of the cyclone device used in this study was shown to have a cut-off of 2 microm, i.e., 50\% of the particles less than 2 microm are not captured. The data reported indicate that the majority of the single particles formed here, {\textless}5 microm, arise from single droplets (of about 10 microm) and are solid, nonporous particles.},

The {FPF} of the spray-dried formulations was stable during storage for {rhuMAbE}25 containing 10\% and 20\% mannitol, but the 30\% formulation exhibited a dramatic decrease upon storage at both 5°Cand30°C,duetomannitolcrystallization.

However, over long-term storage some crystallization was observed even for the phosphate-containing samples, concomitantly with increased particlesizeanddecreasedsuitabilityforaerosoldelivery. Therefore, the physical state of mannitol (i.e., amorphous or crystalline) plays a role both in maintaining protein stability and providing suitable aerosol performance when used as an excipient for spray-dried powders.

A large number of polysaccharides have already been studied for their potential as colon-specific drug carrier systems, such as chitosan, pectin, chondroitin sulphate, cyclodextrin, dextrans, guar gum, inulin, amylose and locust bean gum.

The release of both G-Ins and {cAMP} was triggered by the introduction of saccharides. The selectivity of {FITC}-G-Ins release toward a series of carbohydrate triggers was determined to be fructose {\textgreater} glucose {\textgreater} other saccharides. The unique feature of this double-release system is that the decrease of {FITC}-G-Ins release with cycles can be balanced by the release of {cAMP} from mesopores of {MSN}, which is regulated by the gatekeeper effect of {FITC}-G-Ins. In vitro controlled release of {cAMP} was studied at two {pH} conditions ({pH} 7.4 and 8.5). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of {cAMP}-loaded G-Ins-{MSN} with four different cell lines was investigated by cell viability and proliferation studies. The cellular uptake properties of {cAMP}-loaded {FITC}-{BA}-{MSN} with and without G-Ins capping were investigated by flow cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy.

	abstract = {Diffusion coefficients of organic species in secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) particles are needed to predict the growth and reactivity of these particles in the atmosphere. Previously, viscosity measurements along with the Stokes–Einstein relation have been used to estimate diffusion rates of organics within {SOA} particles or proxies of {SOA} particles. To test the Stokes–Einstein relation, we have measured the diffusion coefficients of three fluorescent organic dyes (fluorescein, Rhodamine 6G and calcein) within sucrose-water solutions with varying water activity. Sucrose-water solutions are used as a proxy for {SOA} material found in the atmosphere. Diffusion coefficients were measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. For the three dyes studied the diffusion coefficients varies by 5–7 orders of magnitude as the water activity varied from 0.38 to 0.88, illustrating the sensitivity of the diffusion coefficients to the water content in the matrix. At the lowest water activity studied (0.38) the average diffusion coefficients were 1.8 × 10−5, 1.6 × 10−6 and 7.6 × 10−6 µm2 s−1 for fluorescein, Rhodamine 6G and calcein, respectively. The measured diffusion coefficients were compared with predictions made using literature viscosities and the Stokes–Einstein relation. We found that at a water activity ≥ 0.6 (which corresponds to a viscosity ≤ 360 Pa s and Tg/T ≤ 0.81) predicted diffusion rates agreed with measured diffusion rates within the experimental uncertainty. (Tg represents the glass transition temperature and T is the temperature of the measurements). When the water activity was 0.38 (which corresponds to a viscosity of 3.3 × 106 Pa s and a Tg/T of 0.94) the Stokes–Einstein relation under-predicted the diffusion coefficients of fluorescein, Rhodamine 6G and calcein by a factor of 95 (minimum 7 and maximum of 980), a factor of 17 (minimum 1 and maximum 165) and a factor of 56 (minimum 7 and maximum 465), respectively.

	abstract = {Atmospheric models generally assume that aerosol particles are in equilibrium with the surrounding gas phase. However, recent observations that secondary organic aerosols can exist in a glassy state have highlighted the need to more fully understand the kinetic limitations that may control water partitioning in ambient particles. Here, we explore the influence of slow water diffusion in the condensed aerosol phase on the rates of both condensation and evaporation, demonstrating that significant inhibition in mass transfer occurs for ultraviscous aerosol, not just for glassy aerosol. Using coarse mode (3-4 um radius) ternary sucrose/sodium chloride/aqueous droplets as a proxy for multicomponent ambient aerosol, we demonstrate that the timescale for particle equilibration correlates with bulk viscosity and can be ≫10(3) s. Extrapolation of these timescales to particle sizes in the accumulation mode (e.g., approximately 100 nm) by applying the Stokes-Einstein equation suggests that the kinetic limitations imposed on mass transfer of water by slow bulk phase diffusion must be more fully investigated for atmospheric aerosol. Measurements have been made on particles covering a range in dynamic viscosity from {\textless} 0.1 to {\textgreater} 10(13) Pa s. We also retrieve the radial inhomogeneities apparent in particle composition during condensation and evaporation and contrast the dynamics of slow dissolution of a viscous core into a labile shell during condensation with the slow percolation of water during evaporation through a more homogeneous viscous particle bulk.},

This result differs from that reported previously for the diffusion of glycerol in its aqueous solutions, where the reduced temperature for the decoupling decreases with increasing water content.

In order to understand the impacts that this may have on aerosol–cloud interactions and atmospheric chemistry, knowledge of water diffusion within such aerosol particles is required. Here, a method is described in which Raman spectroscopy is used to observe D2O diffusion in high-viscosity aqueous solutions, enabling a quantitative assessment of water diffusion coefficients, Dwater, as a function of relative humidity. Results for sucrose solutions compare well with literature data at 23.5 ± 0.3 °C, and demonstrate that water diffusion is slow (Dwater  ̃5 × 10−17 m2 s−1), but not arrested, just below the glass transition at a water activity of 0.2. Room temperature water diffusion coefficients are also presented for aqueous levoglucosan and an aqueous mixture of raffinose, dicarboxylic acids and ammonium sulphate: at low humidity, diffusion is retarded but still occurs on millisecond to second timescales in atmospherically relevant-sized particles. The effect of gel formation on diffusion in magnesium sulfate solutions is shown to be markedly different from the gradual decrease in diffusion coefficients of highly viscous liquids. We show that using the Stokes–Einstein equation to determine diffusion timescales from viscosity leads to values which are more than 5 orders of magnitude too big, which emphasises the need to make measurements of diffusion coefficients. In addition, comparison of bounce fraction data for levoglucosan with measured diffusion data reveals that even when particles bounce the diffusion timescales for water are a fraction of a second for a 100 nm particle. This suggests a high bounce fraction does not necessarily indicate retarded water diffusion.},

	abstract = {Abstract. When simulating the formation and life cycle of secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}) with chemical transport models, it is often assumed that organic molecules are well mixed within {SOA} particles on the timescale of 1h. While this assumption has been debated vigorously in the literature, the issue remains unresolved in part due to a lack of information on the mixing times within {SOA} particles as a function of both temperature and relative humidity. Using laboratory data, meteorological fields, and a chemical transport model, we estimated how often mixing times are {\textless} 1h within {SOA} in the planetary boundary layer ({PBL}), the region of the atmosphere where {SOA} concentrations are on average the highest. First, a parameterization for viscosity as a function of temperature and {RH} was developed for α-pinene {SOA} using room-temperature and low-temperature viscosity data for α-pinene {SOA} generated in the laboratory using mass concentrations of ∼ 1000µg m−3. Based on this parameterization, the mixing times within α-pinene {SOA} are {\textless} 1h for 98.5\% and 99.9\% of the occurrences in the {PBL} during January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant (total organic aerosol concentrations are {\textgreater} 0.5µg m−3 at the surface). Next, as a starting point to quantify how often mixing times of organic molecules are {\textless} 1h within α-pinene {SOA} generated using low, atmospherically relevant mass concentrations, we developed a temperature-independent parameterization for viscosity using the room-temperature viscosity data for α-pinene {SOA} generated in the laboratory using a mass concentration of ∼ 70µg m−3. Based on this temperature-independent parameterization, mixing times within α-pinene {SOA} are {\textless} 1h for 27 and 19.5\% of the occurrences in the {PBL} during January and July, respectively, when concentrations are significant. However, associated with these conclusions are several caveats, and due to these caveats we are unable to make strong conclusions about how often mixing times of organic molecules are {\textless} 1h within α-pinene {SOA} generated using low, atmospherically relevant mass concentrations. Finally, a parameterization for viscosity of anthropogenic {SOA} as a function of temperature and {RH} was developed using sucrose–water data.

Sprays are considered critical for human health, because the lungs represent a major route for the uptake of {ENP} into the human body. To contribute to the exposure assessment of {ENP} in consumer spray products, we analyzed {ENP} in four commercially available sprays: one antiperspirant, two shoe impregnation sprays, and one plant-strengthening agent. The spray dispersions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ({ICPMS}) and (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy ((S){TEM}). Aerosols were generated by using the original vessels, and analyzed by scanning mobility particle sizer ({SMPS}) and (S){TEM}. On the basis of {SMPS} results, the nanosized aerosol depositing in the respiratory tract was modeled for female and male consumers. The derived exposure levels reflect a single spray application. We identified {ENP} in the dispersions of two products (shoe impregnation and plant spray). Nanosized aerosols were observed in three products that contained propellant gas. The aerosol number concentration increased linearly with the sprayed amount, with the highest concentration resulting from the antiperspirant. Modeled aerosol exposure levels were in the range of 1010 nanosized aerosol components per person and application event for the antiperspirant and the impregnation sprays, with the largest fraction of nanosized aerosol depositing in the alveolar region. Negligible exposure from the application of the plant spray (pump spray) was observed.},

In this perspective, we analyse and discuss the formation and properties of amorphous semi-solids and glasses from organic liquids. Based on a systematic survey of a wide range of organic compounds, we present estimates for the glass forming properties of atmospheric secondary organic aerosol ({SOA}). In particular we investigate the dependence of the glass transition temperature T(g) upon various molecular properties such as the compounds' melting temperature, their molar mass, and their atomic oxygen-to-carbon ratios (O:C ratios). Also the effects of mixing different compounds and the effects of hygroscopic water uptake depending on ambient relative humidity are investigated. In addition to the effects of temperature, we suggest that molar mass and water content are much more important than the O:C ratio for characterizing whether an organic aerosol particle is in a liquid, semi-solid, or glassy state. Moreover, we show how the viscosity in liquid, semi-solid and glassy states affect the diffusivity of those molecules constituting the organic matrix as well as that of guest molecules such as water or oxidants, and we discuss the implications for atmospheric multi-phase processes. Finally, we assess the current state of knowledge and the level of scientific understanding, and we propose avenues for future studies to resolve existing uncertainties.},

	abstract = {The size of aerosol particles prior to, and during, inhalation influences the site of deposition within the lung. As such, a detailed understanding of the hygroscopic growth of an aerosol during inhalation is necessary to accurately model the deposited dose. In the first part of this study, it is demonstrated that the aerosol produced by a nebulizer, depending on the airflows rates, may experience a (predictable) wide range of relative humidity prior to inhalation and undergo dramatic changes in both size and solute concentration. A series of sensitive single aerosol analysis techniques are then used to make measurements of the relative humidity dependent thermodynamic equilibrium properties of aerosol generated from four common nebulizer formulations. Measurements are also reported of the kinetics of mass transport during the evaporation or condensation of water from the aerosol. Combined, these measurements allow accurate prediction of the temporal response of the aerosol size prior to and during inhalation. Specifically, we compare aerosol composed of pure saline (150 {mM} sodium chloride solution in ultrapure water) with two commercially available nebulizer products containing relatively low compound doses: Breath®, consisting of a simple salbutamol sulfate solution (5 mg/2.5 {mL}; 1.7 {mM}) in saline, and Flixotide®Nebules, consisting of a more complex stabilized fluticasone propionate suspension (0.25 mg/{mL}; 0.5 {mM} in saline. A mimic of the commercial product Tobi©(60 mg/{mL} tobramycin and 2.25 mg/{mL} {NaCl}, {pH} 5.5-6.5) is also studied, which was prepared in house. In all cases, the presence of the pharmaceutical was shown to have a profound effect on the magnitude, and in some cases the rate, of the mass flux of water to and from the aerosol as compared to saline. These findings provide physical chemical evidence supporting observations from human inhalation studies, and suggest that using the growth dynamics of a pure saline aerosol in a lung inhalation model to represent nebulizer formulations may not be representative of the actual behavior of the aerosolized drug solutions. © 2014 The Authors.},

Phys.128, 034709 (2008)], indicates that the Stokes–Einstein/Eyring ({SE}/E) equation does not describe the diffusion process controlling crystal growth rates in fragile glass-forming liquids. U kin was defined using the normal growth model and tested for crystal data for inorganic and organic liquids covering a viscosity range of about 10 4 – 10 12 Pa s . Here, we revisit their interesting finding considering two other models: the screw dislocation ({SD}) and the two-dimensional surface nucleated (2D) growth models for nine undercooled oxide liquids, in a wider temperature range, from slightly below the melting point down to the glass transition region T g , thus covering a wider viscosity range: 10 1 – 10 13 Pa s . We then propose and use normalized kinetic coefficients ( M kin ) for the {SD} and 2D growth models. These new kinetic coefficients restore the ability of viscosity to describe the transport part of crystal growth rates ( M kin ∼ 1 / η and ξ ∼ 1 ) from low to moderate viscosities ( η {\textless} 10 6 Pa s ) , and thus the {SE}/E equation works well in this viscosity range for all systems tested. For strong glasses, the {SE}/E equation works well from low to high viscosities, from the melting point down to T g ! However, for at least three fragile liquids, diopside (kink at 1.08 T g , η = 1.6 × 10 8 Pa s ), lead metasilicate (kink at 1.14 T g , η = 4.3 × 10 6 Pa s ), and lithium disilicate (kink at 1.11 T g , η = 1.6 × 10 8 Pa s ), there are clear signs of a breakdown of the {SE}/E equation at these higher viscosities. Our results corroborate the findings of Ediger et al. and demonstrate that viscosity data cannot be used to describe the transport part of the crystal growth (via the {SE}/E equation) in fragile glasses in the neighborhood of T g .},

It is shown that this Rayleigh coefficient can be estimated from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from different parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and efficient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with finite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena.},

However, theory and simulation generally fall orders of magnitude short of biologically relevant time scales. Here we report significant progress toward closing this gap: an atomistic model of the folding of an 80-residue fragment of the λ repressor protein with explicit solvent that captures dynamics on a 10 milliseconds time scale. In addition, we provide a number of predictions that warrant further experimental investigation. For example, our model’s native state is a kinetic hub, and biexponential kinetics arises from the presence of many free-energy basins separated by barriers of different heights rather than a single low barrier along one reaction coordinate (the previously proposed incipient downhill folding scenario).},

Our computational model indicates that in the absence of Ca2+, sub-states in the folded ensemble of {CaM}’s C-terminal domain present chemically and sterically distinct topologies that may facilitate conformational selection. Furthermore, we find that local unfolding is off-pathway for the exchange process relevant for peptide binding, in contrast to prior hypotheses that unfolding might account for binding diversity.

A molecular conformation is described by a vector of 3N orientation-independent {DRID} descriptors where N is the number of molecular centroids, for example, the non-hydrogen atoms in all nonsymmetric groups of a peptide. For two real-world applications (pairwise comparison of snapshots from an explicit solvent simulation of a protease/peptide substrate complex and implicit solvent simulations of reversible folding of a 20-residue β-sheet peptide), the {DRID}-based metric is shown to be about 5 and 15 times faster than coordinate root-mean-square deviation ({cRMSD}) and distance root-mean-square deviation ({dRMSD}), respectively. A single core of a mainstream processor can perform about 108 {DRID} comparisons in one-half a minute. Importantly, the {DRID} metric has closer similarity to kinetic distance than does either {cRMSD} or {dRMSD}. Therefore, {DRID} is suitable for clustering molecular dynamics trajectories for kinetic analysis, for example, by Markov state models. Moreover, conformational space networks and free energy profiles derived by {DRID}-based clustering preserve the kinetic information.},

	abstract = {The effects of a single-point mutation on folding thermodynamics and kinetics are usually interpreted by focusing on the native structure and the transition state. Here, the entire conformational spaces of a 20-residue three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet peptide (double hairpin) and of its single-point mutant W10V are sampled close to the melting temperature by equilibrium folding–unfolding molecular dynamics simulations for a total of 40 μs. The folded state as well as the most populated free energy basins in the denatured state are isolated by grouping conformations according to fast relaxation at equilibrium. Such kinetic analysis provides more detailed and useful information than a simple projection of the free energy. The W10V mutant has the same native structure as the wild type peptide, and similar folding rate and stability. In the denatured state, the N-terminal hairpin is about 20\% more structured in W10V than the wild type mainly because of van der Waals interactions. Notably, the W10V mutation influences also the van der Waals energy at the transition state ensemble causing a shift in the ratio of fluxes between two different transition state regions on parallel folding pathways corresponding to nucleation at either of the two β-hairpins. Previous experimental studies have focused on the effects of denaturant-dependent or temperature-dependent changes in the structure of the denatured state. The atomistic simulations show that a single-point mutation in the central strand of a β-sheet peptide results in remarkable changes in the topography of the denatured state ensemble. These changes modulate the relative accessibility of parallel folding pathways because of kinetic partitioning of the denatured state. Therefore, the observed dependence of the folding process on the starting ensemble raises questions on the biological significance of in vitro folding studies under strongly denaturing conditions.

A common approach is to describe the system dynamics in terms of transitions between coarse partitions of conformational space. In contrast to previous work that partitions the space according to geometric proximity, the authors examine here clustering based on kinetics, merging configurational microstates together so as to identify long-lived, i.e., dynamically metastable, states.

Both systems clearly exhibit metastability, with some kinetically distinct metastable states being geometrically very similar. Using the backbone torsion rotamer pattern to define the microstates, a definition is obtained of metastable states whose lifetimes considerably exceed the memory associated with interstate dynamics, thus allowing the kinetics to be described by a Markov model. This model is shown to be valid by comparison of its predictions with the kinetics obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, clustering based on the hydrogen-bonding pattern fails to identify long-lived metastable states or a reliable Markov model. Finally, an approach is proposed to generate a hierarchical model of networks, each having a different number of metastable states. The model hierarchy yields a qualitative understanding of the multiple time and length scales in the dynamics of biomolecules.},

This paradigm shift in the conceptual framework for these reactions away from semi-classical transition state theory ({TST}, i.e. including zero-point energy, but with no tunnelling correction) has been driven over the recent years by experimental studies of the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}) for these reactions in a range of enzymes, including the tryptophan tryptophylquinone-dependent enzymes such as methylamine dehydrogenase and aromatic amine dehydrogenase, and the flavoenzymes such as morphinone reductase and pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase, which produced observations that are also inconsistent with the simple Bell-correction model of tunnelling. However, these data—especially, the strong temperature dependence of reaction rates and the variable temperature dependence of {KIEs}—are consistent with other tunnelling models (termed full tunnelling models), in which protein and/or substrate fluctuations generate a configuration compatible with tunnelling. These models accommodate substrate/protein (environment) fluctuations required to attain a configuration with degenerate nuclear quantum states and, when necessary, motion required to increase the probability of tunnelling in these states. Furthermore, tunnelling mechanisms in enzymes are supported by atomistic computational studies performed within the framework of modern {TST}, which incorporates quantum nuclear effects.},

	abstract = {The enzyme thymidylate synthase ({TS}) catalyzes a complex reaction that involves forming and breaking at least six covalent bonds. The physical nature of the hydride transfer step in this complex reaction cascade has been studied by means of isotope effects and their temperature dependence. Competitive kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}) on the second-order rate constant (V/K) were measured over a temperature range of 5-45 degrees C. The observed H/T ((T)V/K(H)) and D/T ((T)V/K(D)) {KIEs} were used to calculate the intrinsic {KIEs} throughout the temperature range. The Swain-Schaad relationships between the H/T and D/T V/K {KIEs} revealed that the hydride transfer step is the rate-determining step at the physiological temperature of Escherichia coli (20-30 degrees C) but is only partly rate-determining at elevated and reduced temperatures. H/D {KIE} on the first-order rate constant k(cat) ((D)k = 3.72) has been previously reported [Spencer et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 4212-4222]. Additionally, the Swain-Schaad relationships between that (D)k and the V/K {KIEs} reported here suggested that at 20 degrees C the hydride transfer step is the rate-determining step for both rate constants. Intrinsic {KIEs} were calculated here and were found to be virtually temperature independent ({DeltaE}(a) = 0 within experimental error). The isotope effects on the preexponential Arrhenius factors for the intrinsic {KIEs} were A(H)/A(T) = 6.8 +/- 2.8 and A(D)/A(T) = 1.9 +/- 0.25. Both effects are significantly above the semiclassical (no-tunneling) predicted values and indicate a contribution of quantum mechanical tunneling to this hydride transfer reaction. Tunneling correction to transition state theory would predict that these isotope effects on activation parameters result from no energy of activation for all isotopes. Yet, initial velocity measurements over the same temperature range indicate cofactor inhibition and result in significant activation energy on k(cat) (4.0 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol). Taken together, the temperature-independent {KIEs}, the large isotope effects on the preexponential Arrhenius factors, and a significant energy of activation all suggest vibrationally enhanced hydride tunneling in the {TS}-catalyzed reaction.},

The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a non-Markovian process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},

Here, we demonstrate an automatic, iterative, on-the-fly method for learning and sampling molecular simulations in the context of ligand binding for the case of trypsin–benzamidine binding. The method uses Markov state models to learn a simplified model of the simulations and decide where best to sample from, achieving a converged binding affinity in approximately one microsecond, 1 order of magnitude faster than classical sampling.

The analysis shows that the configurational space contains only three dense sub-states. These states of relatively low free energy correspond to the “native” left-handed helix, a partly helical intermediate, and a hairpin-like structure. The collection of unfolded conformations form a relatively diffuse cloud with little substructure. Internal hydrogen-bonding energies were found to correlate well with the degree of folding. The native helical structure folds from the N terminus; the transition from the major folding intermediate to the native helical structure involves the formation of the two most C-terminal backbone hydrogen bonds. A four-state Markov model was found to describe transition frequencies between the conformational states within error limits, indicating that memory-effects are negligible beyond the nanosecond time-scale. The dominant native state fluctuations were found to be very similar to unfolding motions, suggesting that unfolding pathways can be inferred from fluctuations in the native state. The low-dimensional essential subspace, describing 69 \% of the collective atomic fluctuations, was found to converge at time-scales of the order of one nanosecond at all temperatures investigated, whereas folding/unfolding takes place at significantly longer time-scales, even above the melting temperature.},

	abstract = {The most commonly used theoretical models for describing chemical kinetics are accurate in two limits. When relaxation is fast with respect to reaction time scales, thermal transition state theory ({TST}) is the theoretical tool of choice. In the limit of slow relaxation, an energy resolved description like {RRKM} theory is more appropriate. For intermediate relaxation regimes, where much of the chemistry in nature occurs, theoretical approaches are somewhat less well established. However, in recent years master equation approaches have been successfully used to analyze and predict nonequilibrium chemical kinetics across a range of intermediate relaxation regimes spanning atmospheric, combustion, and (very recently) solution phase organic chemistry. In this article, we describe a Master Equation Solver for Multi-Energy Well Reactions ({MESMER}), a user-friendly, object-oriented, open-source code designed to facilitate kinetic simulations over multi-well molecular energy topologies where energy transfer with an external bath impacts phenomenological kinetics. {MESMER} offers users a range of user options specified via keywords and also includes some unique statistical mechanics approaches like contracted basis set methods and nonadiabatic {RRKM} theory for modeling spin-hopping. It is our hope that the design principles implemented in {MESMER} will facilitate its development and usage by workers across a range of fields concerned with chemical kinetics. As accurate thermodynamics data become more widely available, electronic structure theory is increasingly reliable, and as our fundamental understanding of energy transfer improves, we envision that tools like {MESMER} will eventually enable routine and reliable prediction of nonequilibrium kinetics in arbitrary systems.},

We demonstrate that by using biased simulations, one can obtain highly accurate kinetic information with significantly reduced computational time with respect to unbiased simulations. We describe how to conveniently calculate the transition rates to enter, cross, and exit the membrane in terms of the mean first passage times. To obtain free energy barriers and relaxation times from biased simulations only, we constructed Markov models using the dynamic histogram analysis method ({DHAM}). The permeability coefficients that are calculated from the relaxation times are found to correlate highly with experimentally evaluated values. We show that more generally, certain calculated kinetic properties linked to the crossing of the membrane layer (e.g., barrier height and barrier crossing rates) are good indicators of ordering drugs by permeability. Extending the analysis to a 2D Markov model provides a physical description of the membrane crossing mechanism.},

The conformational landscape of these enzymes was significantly altered during evolution, as pre-existing catalytically active conformational substates became major states in the most evolved variants. We further demonstrate that key residues responsible for these substate conversions can be predicted computationally. Significantly, the identified residues coincide with those positions mutated in the laboratory evolution experiments. This study establishes that distal mutations that affect enzyme catalytic activity can be predicted computationally and thus provides the enzyme (re)design field with a rational strategy to determine promising sites for enhancing activity through mutation.},

In this paper, we extend the applicability of automated Markov state modeling to simulation data of molecular self-assembly and aggregation by constructing collective coordinates from molecular descriptors that are invariant to permutations of molecular indexing. Understanding molecular self-assembly is of critical importance if we want to deepen our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases where the aggregation of misfolded or disordered proteins is thought to be the main culprit. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate our Markov state model technique on simulations of the {KFFE} peptide, a subsequence of Alzheimer’s amyloid-β peptide and one of the smallest peptides known to aggregate into amyloid fibrils in vitro. We investigate the different stages of aggregation up to tetramerization and show that the Markov state models clearly map out the different aggregation pathways. Of note is that disordered and β-sheet oligomers do not interconvert, leading to separate pathways for their formation. This suggests that amyloid aggregation of {KFFE} occurs via ordered aggregates from the very beginning. The code developed here is freely available as a Jupyter notebook called {TICAgg}, which can be used for the automated analysis of any self-assembling molecular system, protein, or otherwise.},

Previous biophysical studies have suggested that conformational exchange between a ‘major’ active and a ‘minor’ inactive state on millisecond timescales plays a key role in catalysis for {CypA}. Here this hypothesis is addressed by a variety of molecular dynamics simulation techniques. Strikingly we show that exchange between major and minor active site conformations occurs at a rate that is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed. The minor active site conformation is found to be catalytically impaired, and decreased catalytic activity of the mutants is caused by changes in Phe113 motions on a ns-μs timescale. Therefore millisecond timescale motions may not be necessary to explain allosteric effects in cyclophilins.},

The analysis is based on trajectories from classical molecular dynamics simulations and accounts for the full dynamics of relative angular and separation coordinates of water clusters and requires no predefined hydrogen bond criterium. We account for the complete 12-dimensional conformational subspace of three water molecules and distinguish five well-separated slow dynamic processes with relaxation times in the picosecond range, followed by a quasi-continuum spectrum of faster modes. By analysis of the Markov eigenstates, these processes are shown to correspond to different collective interchanges of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors. Using a projection onto hydrogen-bond states, we also analyze the switching of one hydrogen bond between two acceptor water molecules and derive the complete transition network. The most probable pathway corresponds to a direct switch without an intermediate, in agreement with previous studies. However, a considerable fraction of paths proceeds along alternative routes that involve different intermediate states with short-lived alternative hydrogen bonds or weakly bound states.},

In this work, we present Dragonﬂy, an open source Python library for scalable and robust {BO}. Dragonﬂy incorporates multiple recently developed methods that allow {BO} to be applied in challenging real world settings; these include better methods for handling higher dimensional domains, methods for handling multi-ﬁdelity evaluations when cheap approximations of an expensive function are available, methods for optimising over structured combinatorial spaces, such as the space of neural network architectures, and methods for handling parallel evaluations. Additionally, we develop new methodological improvements in {BO} for selecting the Bayesian model, selecting the acquisition function, and optimising over complex domains with different variable types and additional constraints. We compare Dragonﬂy to a suite of other packages and algorithms for global optimisation and demonstrate that when the above methods are integrated, they enable signiﬁcant improvements in the performance of {BO}.

	title = {Abstract Bayesian Optimization and Semiparametric Models with Applications to Assistive Technology},
	abstract = {Advances in machine learning are having a profound impact on disciplines spanning the sciences. Assistive technology and health informatics are fields for which minor improvements achieved through leveraging more advanced machine learning algorithms can translate to major real world impact. However, successful application of machine learning currently requires broad domain knowledge to determine which model is appropriate for a given task, and model specific expertise to configure a model to a problem of interest. A major motivation for this thesis was: How can we make machine learning more accessible to assistive technology and health informatics researchers? Naturally, a complementary goal is to make machine learning more accessible in general. Specifically, in this thesis we explore how to automate the role of a machine learning expert through automatically adapting models and adjusting parameters to a given task of interest. This thesis consists of a number of contributions towards solving this challenging open problem in machine learning and these are empirically validated on four real-world applications. Through an interesting theoretical link between two seemingly disparate latent variable models, we create a hybrid model that allows one to flexibly interpolate over a parametric},

	abstract = {Machine Learning applications now span across multiple domains due to the increase in computational power of modern systems. There has been a recent surge in Machine Learning applications in High Performance Computing ({HPC}) in an attempt to speed up training. However, besides training, hyperparameters optimisation({HPO}) is one of the most time consuming and resource intensive parts in a Machine Learning Workflow. Numerous algorithms and tools exist to accelerate the process of finding the right parameters for a model. Most of these tools do not utilize the parallelism provided by modern systems and are serial or limited to a single node. The few ones that are offer distributed execution require a serious amount of programming effort. There is, therefore, a need for a tool/scheme that can scale and leverage {HPC} infrastructures such as supercomputers, with minimum programmers effort and little or no overhead in performance. We present a {HPO} scheme built on top of {PyCOMPSs}, a programming model and runtime which aims to ease the development of parallel applications for distributed infrastructures. We show that {PyCOMPSs} is a powerful framework that can accelerate the process of Hyperparameter Optimisation across multiple devices and computing units. We also show that {PyCOMPSs} provides easy programmability, seamless distribution and scalability, key features missing in existing tools. Furthermore, we perform a detailed performance analysis showing different configurations to demonstrate the effectiveness our approach.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms have been widely used to deal with a variety of practical problems such as computer vision and speech processing. But the performance of machine learning algorithms is primarily affected by their hyper-parameters, as without good hyper-parameter values the performance of these algorithms will be very poor. Unfortunately, for complex machine learning models like deep neural networks, it is very difficult to determine their hyper-parameters. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an efficient algorithm for hyper-parameter automatic optimization. In this paper, a novel hyper-parameter optimization methodology is presented to combine the advantages of a Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search to achieve the efficient search for hyper-parameters of learning algorithms. This method is defined as the Tabu\_Genetic Algorithm. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, two sets of contrast experiments are conducted. The Tabu\_Genetic Algorithm and other four methods are simultaneously used to search for good values of hyper-parameters of deep convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that, compared to Random Search and Bayesian optimization methods, the proposed Tabu\_Genetic Algorithm finds a better model in less time. Whether in a low-dimensional or high-dimensional space, the Tabu\_Genetic Algorithm has better search capabilities as an effective method for finding the hyper-parameters of learning algorithms. The presented method in this paper provides a new solution for solving the hyper-parameters optimization problem of complex machine learning models, which will provide machine learning algorithms with better performance when solving practical problems.},

To address this problem we introduce the element-specific persistent homology ({ESPH}) method. {ESPH} represents 3D complex geometry by one-dimensional (1D) topological invariants and retains important biological information via a multichannel image-like representation. This representation reveals hidden structure-function relationships in biomolecules. We further integrate {ESPH} and deep convolutional neural networks to construct a multichannel topological neural network ({TopologyNet}) for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and protein stability changes upon mutation. To overcome the deep learning limitations from small and noisy training sets, we propose a multi-task multichannel topological convolutional neural network ({MM}-{TCNN}). We demonstrate that {TopologyNet} outperforms the latest methods in the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities, mutation induced globular protein folding free energy changes, and mutation induced membrane protein folding free energy changes.

Recently, a sub-community of machine learning has focused on solving this problem with Sequential Model-based Bayesian Optimization ({SMBO}), demonstrating substantial successes in many applications. However, for computationally expensive algorithms the overhead of hyperparameter optimization can still be prohibitive. In this paper we mimic a strategy human domain experts use: speed up optimization by starting from promising configurations that performed well on similar datasets. The resulting initialization technique integrates naturally into the generic {SMBO} framework and can be trivially applied to any {SMBO} method. To validate our approach, we perform extensive experiments with two established {SMBO} frameworks (Spearmint and {SMAC}) with complementary strengths; optimizing two machine learning frameworks on 57 datasets. Our initialization procedure yields mild improvements for low-dimensional hyperparameter optimization and substantially improves the state of the art for the more complex combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem.},

In Machine Learning, high-quality results are only attainable via mindful data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Domain experts are often overwhelmed by such complexity, de-facto inhibiting a wider adoption of {ML} techniques in other fields. Existing libraries that claim to solve this problem, still require well-trained practitioners. Those frameworks involve heavy data preparation steps and are often too slow for interactive feedback from the user, severely limiting the scope of such systems. In this paper we present Alpine Meadow, a first Interactive Automated Machine Learning tool. What makes our system unique is not only the focus on interactivity, but also the combined systemic and algorithmic design approach; on one hand we leverage ideas from query optimization, on the other we devise novel selection and pruning strategies combining cost-based Multi-Armed Bandits and Bayesian Optimization. We evaluate our system on over 300 datasets and compare against other {AutoML} tools, including the current {NIPS} winner, as well as expert solutions. Not only is Alpine Meadow able to significantly outperform the other {AutoML} systems while --- in contrast to the other systems --- providing interactive latencies, but also outperforms in 80\% of the cases expert solutions over data sets we have never seen before.},

While most previous work has focused on using individual tweets as classifier inputs, here we report on the performance of sequential classifiers that exploit the discourse features inherent in social media interactions or ‘conversational threads’. Testing the effectiveness of four sequential classifiers – Hawkes Processes, Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (Linear {CRF}), Tree-Structured Conditional Random Fields (Tree {CRF}) and Long Short Term Memory networks ({LSTM}) – on eight datasets associated with breaking news stories, and looking at different types of local and contextual features, our work sheds new light on the development of accurate stance classifiers. We show that sequential classifiers that exploit the use of discourse properties in social media conversations while using only local features, outperform non-sequential classifiers. Furthermore, we show that {LSTM} using a reduced set of features can outperform the other sequential classifiers; this performance is consistent across datasets and across types of stances. To conclude, our work also analyses the different features under study, identifying those that best help characterise and distinguish between stances, such as supporting tweets being more likely to be accompanied by evidence than denying tweets. We also set forth a number of directions for future research.},

Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional {ANOVA} framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that—even in very high-dimensional cases—most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

These results only require explicit simulations on the sub-milliseconds timescale and are tested against existing mutagenesis data and our own experimental measurements of the dissociation and association rates.

	abstract = {Dimensionality reduction techniques have found great success in a wide range of fields requiring analysis of high-dimensional datasets. Time-lagged independent components analysis ({TICA}), which finds independent components ({TICs}) with maximal autocorrelation, is often applied to atomistic biomolecular simulations, where the full molecular configuration can be projected onto only a few {TICs} describing the slowest modes of motion. Recently, Sultan and Pande have proposed the use of {TICs} as collective variables for enhanced sampling. However, it is unclear what the best strategy for estimating the {TICs} of a system is a priori. In order to evaluate the utility of {TICs} calculated on one system to describe the slow dynamics of similar systems, we develop a methodology for measuring the transferability of {TICs} and apply it to a wide range of systems. We find that transferred {TICs} can approximate the slowest dynamics of some systems surprisingly well, while failing to transfer between other sets of systems, highlighting the inherent difficulties of predicting {TIC} transferability. Additionally, we use two dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations on similar potential surfaces to gain insight into the relationship between {TIC} transferability and potential surface changes.},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}), which model conformational dynamics as a network of transitions between metastable states, have been increasingly used to model the thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecules. In considering perturbations to molecular dynamics induced by sequence mutations, chemical modifications, or changes in external conditions, it is important to assess how transition rates change, independent of changes in metastable state definitions. Here, we present a surprisal metric to quantify the difference in metastable state transitions for two closely related {MSMs}, taking into account the statistical uncertainty in observed transition counts. We show that the surprisal is a relative entropy metric closely related to the Jensen–Shannon divergence between two {MSMs}, which can be used to identify conformational states most affected by perturbations. As examples, we apply the surprisal metric to a two-dimensional lattice model of a protein hairpin with mutations to hydrophobic residues, all-atom simulations of the Fs peptide α-helix with a salt-bridge mutation, and a comparison of protein G β-hairpin with its trpzip4 variant. Moreover, we show that surprisal-based adaptive sampling is an efficient strategy to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the Jensen–Shannon divergence, which could be a useful strategy for molecular simulation-based ab initio design.},

Here, we build upon diﬀusion map theory and deﬁne a kinetic distance metric for irreducible Markov processes that quantiﬁes how slowly molecular conformations interconvert. The kinetic distance can be computed given a model that approximates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (reaction coordinates) of the {MD} Markov operator. Here, we employ the time-lagged independent component analysis ({TICA}). The {TICA} components can be scaled to provide a kinetic map in which the Euclidean distance corresponds to the kinetic distance. As a result, the question of how many {TICA} dimensions should be kept in a dimensionality reduction approach becomes obsolete, and one parameter less needs to be speciﬁed in the kinetic model construction. We demonstrate the approach using {TICA} and Markov state model ({MSM}) analyses for illustrative models, protein conformation dynamics in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and protein-inhibitor association in trypsin and benzamidine. We ﬁnd that the total kinetic variance ({TKV}) is an excellent indicator of model quality and can be used to rank diﬀerent input feature sets.},

The simulations reveal subtle and surprising underlying dynamical changes: tightening of loops around the active site is observed, along with changes in energetic fluctuations across the whole enzyme including important contributions from oligomeric neighbours and domains distal to the active site. This has general implications for understanding enzyme catalysis and demonstrating a direct connection between functionally important microscopic dynamics and macroscopically measurable quantities.},

	abstract = {Large-scale conformational change is a common feature in the catalytic cycles of enzymes. Many enzymes function as homodimers with active sites that contain elements from both chains. Symmetric and anti-symmetric cooperative motions in homodimers can potentially lead to correlated active site opening and/or closure, likely to be important for ligand binding and release. Here, we examine such motions in two different domain-swapped homodimeric enzymes: the {DcpS} scavenger decapping enzyme and citrate synthase. We use and compare two types of all-atom simulations: conventional molecular dynamics simulations to identify physically meaningful conformational ensembles, and rapid geometric simulations of flexible motion, biased along normal mode directions, to identify relevant motions encoded in the protein structure. The results indicate that the opening/closure motions are intrinsic features of both unliganded enzymes. In {DcpS}, conformational change is dominated by an anti-symmetric cooperative motion, causing one active site to close as the other opens; however a symmetric motion is also significant. In {CS}, we identify that both symmetric (suggested by crystallography) and asymmetric motions are features of the protein structure, and as a result the behaviour in solution is largely non-cooperative. The agreement between two modelling approaches using very different levels of theory indicates that the behaviours are indeed intrinsic to the protein structures. Geometric simulations correctly identify and explore large amplitudes of motion, while molecular dynamics simulations indicate the ranges of motion that are energetically feasible. Together, the simulation approaches are able to reveal unexpected functionally relevant motions, and highlight differences between enzymes.},

	abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

We demonstrate an enormous flexibility of this Bayes estimator by including the Poisson noise in fluorometry data and open-channel noise in current data. The accuracy of the parameter estimation is increased by tenfold if compared to fitting Rate Equations and the selection of the most likely kinetic model is improved. The algorithm allows to avoid overfitting by continuous model expansion, by cross-validation, by applying the ‘widely applicable information criterion’ or variance-based model selection. In contrast, detecting the true kinetic scheme with Rate Equations is only successful in combination with cross validation.

	url = {https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/15563},
	abstract = {For the last 50 years changes to the fluorescence properties of 2-aminopurine have been used to probe the structure and dynamics of {DNA}. 2-Aminopurine's utility has arisen from the quenching of its emission when pi-stacked with neighboring nucleobases. In the time-domain, the emission decay profile of 2-aminopurine requires multiple exponential decay components to model. Despite its extensive usage, the microscopic origin of the decay heterogeneity is not clear. In this thesis, steady-state absorption, fluorescence, and time-resolved fluorescence results are compared to multiple microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of 2-aminopurine-labeled adenine containing single-stranded {DNA} oligomers of varying length and position of the 2-aminopurine probe. First, previous reports of ultrafast electron transfer in pi-stacked adenine oligomers are used to build a new model for quenching of 2-aminopurine that is pi-stacked with adenine. For dinucleotides, a static distribution of unstacked structures combined with a distance dependent electron transfer mechanism is posited to explain the disperse emission decay timescales. Investigating the dinucleotides with molecular dynamics simulations analyzed with Markov state models quantify the structural heterogeneity of the dinucleotides. At least seven structures are sampled that could alter the quenching of 2-aminopurines's fluorescence. The Markov state models also demonstrate the timescales for transitions between these structures range from 1.6 to 25 ns, suggesting 2-aminopurine, with its monomer-like lifetime of 10 ns, is sensitive to the conformational dynamics of the dinucleotides as well. This dual fluorescence quenching and molecular dynamics simulation approach is extended to 2-aminopurine labeled trinucleotides and 15 base oligomers to interrogate the position dependent structural heterogeneity and conformational dynamics in these systems. Both shifts in the experimental absorption spectra, and molecular dynamics simulations agree that the interior base is more likely to be stacked than the exterior bases. Time-resolved emission experiments reveal emission from 2-aminopurine is quenched faster on the 5' end relative to the 3' end, in agreement with the faster stacking kinetics observed for bases on the 5' end relative to the 3' end obtained from molecular dynamics simulation. These results suggest that the time-resolved emission from 2-aminopurine may serve as an experimental observable for calibration of the dynamical properties predicted by molecular dynamics simulation.},

Class A \&beta;-lactamases are structurally and functionally related to penicillin-binding proteins ({PBPs}). Despite the extensive studies of the structures, catalytic mechanisms and dynamics of both \&beta;-lactamases and {PBPs}, the potentially different dynamical behaviors of these proteins in different functional states still remain elusive in general. In this study, four evolutionarily related proteins, including {TEM}-1 and {TOHO}-1 as class A \&beta;-lactamases, {PBP}-A and {DD}-transpeptidase as two {PBPs}, are subjected to molecular dynamics simulations and various analyses to characterize their dynamical behaviors in different functional states. Penicillin G and its ring opening product serve as common ligands for these four proteins of interest. The dynamic analyses of overall structures, the active sites with penicillin G, and three catalytically important residues commonly shared by all four proteins reveal unexpected cross similarities between Class A \&beta;-lactamases and {PBPs}. These findings shed light on both the hidden relations among dynamical behaviors of these proteins and the functional and evolutionary relations among class A \&beta;-lactamases and {PBPs}.},

Bestatin, a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor, is a moderate inhibitor of {PfA}-M1, and has been used to provide structure?activity relationships to inform drug design. The crystal structure of {PfA}-M1 with bestatin bound within its active site has been determined; however, dynamics of the inhibitor and the association or dissociation pathway have yet to be characterized. Here we present an all-atom molecular dynamics study where we have generated a hidden Markov state model from 2.3??s of molecular dynamics simulation. Our hidden Markov state model identifies five macrostates that clearly show the events involved in bestatin dissociation from the {PfA}-M1 active site. The results show for the first time that bestatin can escape the substrate specificity pockets of the enzyme, primarily due to weak interactions within the pockets. Our approach identifies relevant conformational sampling of the inhibitor inside the enzyme and the protein dynamics that could be exploited to produce potent and selective inhibitors that can differentiate between similar members of the M1 aminopeptidase superfamily.},

	abstract = {Since the availability of the first crystal structure of a bacterial Na+ channel in 2011, understanding selectivity across this family of membrane proteins has been the subject of intense research efforts. Initially, free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations revealed that although sodium ions can easily permeate the channel with their first hydration shell almost intact, the selectivity filter is too narrow for efficient conduction of hydrated potassium ions. This steric view of selectivity was subsequently questioned by microsecond atomic trajectories, which proved that the selectivity filter appears to the permeating ions as a highly degenerate, liquid-like environment. Although this liquid-like environment looks optimal for rapid conduction of Na+, it seems incompatible with efficient discrimination between similar ion species, such as Na+ and K+, through steric effects. Here extensive molecular dynamics simulations, combined with Markov state model analyses, reveal that at positive membrane potentials, potassium ions trigger a conformational change of the selectivity toward a nonconductive metastable state. It is this transition of the selectivity filter, and not steric effects, that prevents the outward flux of K+ at positive membrane potentials. This description of selectivity, triggered by the nature of the permeating ions, might have implications on the current understanding of how ion channels, and in particular bacterial Na+ channels, operate at the atomic scale.},

To understand the structural basis of promiscuous inhibitor binding, we determined the co-crystal structure of the receptor tyrosine kinase {DDR}1 with the type I inhibitors dasatinib and {VX}-680. Surprisingly, we find that {DDR}1 binds these type I inhibitors in an inactive conformation typically reserved for type {II} inhibitors.

By combining molecular dynamics simulations with Markov and hidden Markov models, we obtained a detailed kinetic network of the substates of the Michaelis complex of {LDH}. The ensemble-average electric fields exerted onto the vibrational probe were calculated to provide a direct comparison with the vibrational spectroscopy. Structural features of the Michaelis substates were also analyzed on atomistic scales.

By atomistically capturing the full process of spontaneous substrate association from bulk solvent to the occluded catalytic center of an archetypal system P450cam in multi-microsecond-long continuous unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we here demonstrate that the substrate recognition in P450cam always occurs through a single well-defined dominant pathway. The simulated final bound pose resulting from these unguided simulations is in striking resemblance with the crystallographic bound pose. Each individual binding trajectory reveals that the substrate, initially placed at random locations in bulk solvent, spontaneously lands on a single key channel on the protein–surface of P450cam and resides there for an uncharacteristically long period, before correctly identifying the occluded target-binding cavity. Surprisingly, the passage of substrate to the closed catalytic center is not accompanied by any large-scale opening in protein. Rather, the unbiased simulated trajectories (∼57 μs) and underlying Markov state model, in combination with free-energy analysis, unequivocally show that the substrate recognition process in P450cam needs a substrate-induced side-chain displacement coupled with a complex array of dynamical interconversions of multiple metastable substrate conformations. Further, the work reconciles multiple precedent experimental and theoretical observations on P450cam and establishes a comprehensive view of substrate-recognition in cytochrome P450 that only occurs via substrate-induced structural rearrangements.},

When these states have distinct chemical shifts, the measurement of relaxation by {NMR} may provide us with useful information about their structure, kinetics, and thermodynamics at atomic resolution. However, as these experimental data are sensitive to many structural and dynamic effects, their interpretation with phenomenological models is challenging, even if only a few metastable states are involved. Consequently, approximations and simplifications must often be used which increase the risk of missing important microscopic features hidden in the data. Here, we show how molecular dynamics simulations analyzed through Markov state models and the related hidden Markov state models may be used to establish mechanistic models that provide a microscopic interpretation of {NMR} relaxation data. Using ubiquitin and {BPTI} as examples, we demonstrate how the approach allows us to dissect experimental data into a number of dynamic processes between metastable states. Such a microscopic view may greatly facilitate the mechanistic interpretation of experimental data and serve as a next-generation method for the validation of molecular mechanics force fields and chemical shift prediction algorithms.},

Existing approaches to this problem, including Markov state models and the variational approach, represent the dominant eigenfunctions as linear combinations of a set of basis functions. However the choice of the basis functions and their systematic statistical estimation are unsolved problems. Here, we propose a new class of kinetic models called Markov transition models ({MTMs}) that approximate the transition density of the {MD} propagator by a mixture of probability densities. Specifically, we use Gaussian {MTMs} where a Gaussian mixture model is used to approximate the symmetrized transition density. This approach allows for a direct computation of spectral components. In contrast with the other Galerkin-type approximations, our approach can automatically adjust the involved Gaussian basis functions and handle the statistical uncertainties in a Bayesian framework. We demonstrate by some simulation examples the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene ({\textasciitilde}106 M-1s-1). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies multiple ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up multiple pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a single dominant pathway for ligand binding.},

We then adapt these results to diffusion processes via a limiting procedure, reaffirming that diffusions saturate the inequality. Finally, we study the impact of spatial coarse-graining in a two-dimensional model with driven diffusion. By observing fluctuations in coarse-grained currents, it is possible to infer a lower bound on the total dissipation rate, including the dissipation associated with hidden dynamics. The tightness of this bound depends on how well the spatial coarse-graining detects dynamical events that are driven by large thermodynamic forces.},

Markov models, or Markov state models, are widely used but suffer from the fact that the dynamics on a coarsely discretized state spaced are no longer Markovian, even if the dynamics in the full phase space are. The recently proposed projected Markov models ({PMMs}) are a formulation that provides a description of the kinetics on a low-dimensional projection without making the Markovianity assumption.

However, to achieve satisfactory performance, existing methodologies often require expert intervention when defining the model’s discrete state space. While standard model selection methodologies focus on the minimization of systematic bias and disregard statistical error, we show that by consideration of the states’ conditional distribution over conformations, both sources of error can be balanced evenhandedly. Application of techniques that consider both systematic bias and statistical error on two 100 μs molecular dynamics trajectories of the Fip35 {WW} domain shows agreement with existing techniques based on self-consistency of the model’s relaxation time scales with more suitable results in regimes in which those time scale-based techniques encourage overfitting.

Considering the distribution P(x) of the {CVs}, the primal goal of a statistical analysis is to detect the characteristic features of P(x), in particular, its maxima and their connection paths. This is because these features characterize the low-energy regions and the energy barriers of the corresponding free energy landscape ΔG(x) = −{kBT} ln P(x), and therefore amount to the metastable states and transition regions of the system. In this perspective, we outline a systematic strategy to identify {CVs} and metastable states, which subsequently can be employed to construct a Langevin or a Markov state model of the dynamics. In particular, we account for the still limited sampling typically achieved by molecular dynamics simulations, which in practice seriously limits the applicability of theories (e.g., assuming ergodicity) and black-box software tools (e.g., using redundant input coordinates). We show that it is essential to use internal (rather than Cartesian) input coordinates, employ dimensionality reduction methods that avoid rescaling errors (such as principal component analysis), and perform density based (rather than k-means-type) clustering. Finally, we briefly discuss a machine learning approach to dimensionality reduction, which highlights the essential internal coordinates of a system and may reveal hidden reaction mechanisms.},

Besides the demand in improving simulation techniques to approach experimental scales, it becomes more and more crucial to develop robust methodology for precisely and objectively interpreting massive {MD} simulation data. In our previous work [J Phys Chem B 114, 10266 (2010)], the trajectory mapping ({TM}) method was presented to analyze simulation trajectories then to construct a kinetic transition network of metastable states. In this work, we further present a top-down implementation of {TM} to systematically detect complicate features of conformational space. We first look at longer {MD} trajectory pieces to get a coarse picture of transition network at larger time scale, and then we gradually cut the trajectory pieces in shorter for more details. A robust clustering algorithm is designed to more effectively identify the metastable states and transition events. We applied this {TM} method to detect the hierarchical structure in the conformational space of alanine-dodeca-peptide from microsecond to nanosecond time scales. The results show a downhill folding process of the peptide through multiple pathways. Even in this simple system, we found that single common-used order parameter is not sufficient either in distinguishing the metastable states or predicting the transition kinetics among these states.},

Here, we have developed a path lumping method to group these parallel pathways into metastable path channels for analysis. We define the similarity between two pathways as the intercrossing flux between them and then apply the spectral clustering algorithm to lump these pathways into groups. We demonstrate the power of our method by applying it to two systems: a 2D-potential consisting of four metastable energy channels and the hydrophobic collapse process of two hydrophobic molecules. In both cases, our algorithm successfully reveals the metastable path channels.

	abstract = {Markov State Model ({MSM}) has become a popular approach to study the conformational dynamics of complex biological systems in recent years. Built upon a large number of short molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, {MSM} is able to predict the long time scale dynamics of complex systems. However, to achieve Markovianity, an {MSM} often contains hundreds or thousands of states (microstates), hindering human interpretation of the underlying system mechanism. One way to reduce the number of states is to lump kinetically similar states together and thus coarse-grain the microstates into macrostates. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic lumping algorithm, the Gibbs lumping algorithm, to assign a probability to any given kinetic lumping using the Bayesian inference. In our algorithm, the transitions among kinetically distinct macrostates are modeled by Poisson processes, which will well reflect the separation of time scales in the underlying free energy landscape of biomolecules. Furthermore, to facilitate the search for the optimal kinetic lumping (i.e., the lumped model with the highest probability), a Gibbs sampling algorithm is introduced. To demonstrate the power of our new method, we apply it to three systems: a 2D potential, alanine dipeptide, and a {WW} protein domain. In comparison with six other popular lumping algorithms, we show that our method can persistently produce the lumped macrostate model with the highest probability as well as the largest metastability. We anticipate that our Gibbs lumping algorithm holds great promise to be widely applied to investigate conformational changes in biological macromolecules.},

	abstract = {Markov state models can describe ensembles of pathways via kinetic networks but are difficult to create when large free-energy barriers limit unbiased sampling. Chain-of-states simulations allow sampling over large free-energy barriers but are often constructed using a single pathway that is unlikely to thermodynamically average over orthogonal degrees of freedom in complex systems. Here, we combine the advantages of these two approaches in the form of a Markov state model of Markov state models, which we call a Hierarchical Markov state model. In this approach, independent Markov models are constructed in regions of configuration space that are locally well sampled but are separated by large free-energy barriers from other regions. A string method is used to construct an ensemble of pathways connecting the states of these different local Markov models, and the rate through each pathway is then estimated. These rates are then combined with the rate information from the local Markov models in a master equation to predict global rates, fluxes, and populations. By applying this hierarchical approach to tractable systems, a toy potential and dipeptides, we demonstrate that it is more accurate than the conventional single-pathway description. The advantages of this approach are that it (i) is more realistic than the conventional chain-of-states approach, as an ensemble of pathways rather than a single pathway is used to describe processes in high-dimensional systems, and (ii) it resolves the issue of poor sampling in Markov State model building when large free-energy barriers are present. The divide-and-conquer strategy inherent to this approach should make this procedure straightforward to apply to more complex systems.},

	abstract = {The conformational dynamics of multibody systems plays crucial roles in many important problems. Markov state models ({MSMs}) are powerful kinetic network models that can predict long-time-scale dynamics using many short molecular dynamics simulations. Although {MSMs} have been successfully applied to conformational changes of individual proteins, the analysis of multibody systems is still a challenge because of the complexity of the dynamics that occur on a mixture of drastically different time scales. In this work, we have developed a new algorithm, automatic state partitioning for multibody systems ({APM}), for constructing {MSMs} to elucidate the conformational dynamics of multibody systems. The {APM} algorithm effectively addresses different time scales in the multibody systems by directly incorporating dynamics into geometric clustering when identifying the metastable conformational states. We have applied the {APM} algorithm to a 2D potential that can mimic a protein–ligand binding system and the aggregation of two hydrophobic particles in water and have shown that it can yield tremendous enhancements in the computational efficiency of {MSM} construction and the accuracy of the models.},

	abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: • From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. • Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. • Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. • Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. • Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. • In “nonstandard” statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. • The Schwarz criterion (or {BIC}) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. • When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. • Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. • Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. • It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

	abstract = {Methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}), an alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme from numerous methylotrophic soil bacteria, contains a novel quinonoid redox prosthetic group that is covalently bound to its small beta subunit through two amino acyl residues. A comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the small subunit for the enzyme from Methylobacterium extorquens {AM}1 with the published amino acid sequence obtained by the Edman degradation method, allowed the identification of the amino acyl constituents of the cofactor as two tryptophyl residues. This information was crucial for interpreting 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectral data collected for the semicarbazide- and carboxymethyl-derivatized bis(tripeptidyl)-cofactor of {MADH} from bacterium W3A1. The cofactor is composed of two cross-linked tryptophyl residues. Although there are many possible isomers, only one is consistent with all the data: The first tryptophyl residue in the peptide sequence exists as an indole-6,7-dione, and is attached at its 4 position to the 2 position of the second, otherwise unmodified, indole side group. Contrary to earlier reports, the cofactor of {MADH} is not 2,7,9-tricarboxypyrroloquinoline quinone ({PQQ}), a derivative thereof, or pro-{PQQ}. This appears to be the only example of two cross-linked, modified amino acyl residues having a functional role in the active site of an enzyme, in the absence of other cofactors or metal ions.},

	abstract = {Binding and electron transfer reactions between the tryptophan tryptophylquinone ({TTQ}) enzyme, aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}), and the type I copper protein azurin have been characterized. In steady-state kinetic assays using azurin as an electron acceptor, it was observed that the apparent Km for azurin decreased with increasing ionic strength. These results are the opposite of what was observed for the reaction between the {TTQ} enzyme methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}) and amicyanin, despite the fact that in both cases the pairs of redox proteins are each acidic proteins. It was further demonstrated that azurin does not function as an effective electron acceptor for {MADH}, and that amicyanin does not function as an effective electron acceptor for {AADH}. Thus, while the two {TTQ} enzymes each use type I copper proteins as physiologic electron acceptors, there is a strong specificity for which copper protein serves as a redox partner. The kinetic parameters for the electron transfer reactions from reduced {AADH} to oxidized azurin were determined by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Different results were obtained depending upon whether {AADH} was reduced chemically with dithionite or with the substrate tyramine. The values for the limiting first-order apparent electron transfer rate constant (\&{ET}) at 30 °C were 4 and 102 s\_1, respectively. Kinetically determined values of Kd also differed by a factor of 2.4. These data suggest that the incorporation of the substrate-derived amino group into the reduced {TTQ} of {AADH} significantly increases the apparent \& · The interaction between {AADH} and azurin was also quantitated using an ultrafiltration binding assay. This yielded a Kd of 300 µ for the {AADH}—azurin complex. This Kd correlated well with the kinetically determined Kd values obtained from the stoppedflow kinetic studies. Similarities and differences i the reactivities of the {AADH}-azurin and {MADHamicyanin} redox pairs are discussed.},

	abstract = {Polystyrene ({PS})  is a synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon polymer made from the monomer  known as styrene. Polystyrene can be solid or foamed. General-purpose polystyrene is clear, hard, and rather brittle. It is an inexpensive resin per unit weight. It is a rather poor barrier to oxygen and water vapour and has a relatively low melting point. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, the scale of its production being several million tonnes per year. Polystyrene can be naturally transparent, but can be coloured with colourants. Uses include protective packaging (such as packing peanuts and {CD} and {DVD} cases), containers, lids, bottles, trays, tumblers, disposable cutlery and in the making of models.
As a thermoplastic polymer, polystyrene is in a solid (glassy) state at room temperature but flows if heated above about 100 °C, its glass transition temperature.  It becomes rigid again when cooled.  This temperature behaviour is exploited for extrusion (as in Styrofoam) and also for molding and vacuum forming, since it can be cast into molds with fine detail.
Under {ASTM} standards, polystyrene is regarded as not biodegradable. It is accumulating as a form of litter in the outside environment, particularly along shores and waterways, especially in its foam form, and in the Pacific Ocean.},

It is interesting to analyze the polymer distribution uniformity across the web because it affects many end-use properties. By utilizing the technique of differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}), a standard working line between heat of fusion and weight percentage was constructed for mixtures of {PP} and {PET} components. The fitted equations were used for determination of a component percentage in a certain position across the {MB} web. Measurements were conducted from {DSC} re-heating curves to achieve accurate results. The distribution of polymer varies with polymer mass ratio and processing conditions. The overall uniformity increased with the percentage of {PP}. When {PP} is the minor component in the polymer pair, it exhibits notably higher percentage in edge areas across the {MB} web. These results suggest the phase interface distortion of the polymer melt occurred at the entrance of the {MB} coat-hanger die tip.

However, its practical benefits still remain unproven in real-world applications, particularly in polymer science. We demonstrate the successful discovery of new polymers with high thermal conductivity, inspired by machine-learning-assisted polymer chemistry. This discovery was made by the interplay between machine intelligence trained on a substantially limited amount of polymeric properties data, expertise from laboratory synthesis and advanced technologies for thermophysical property measurements. Using a molecular design algorithm trained to recognize quantitative structure—property relationships with respect to thermal conductivity and other targeted polymeric properties, we identified thousands of promising hypothetical polymers. From these candidates, three were selected for monomer synthesis and polymerization because of their synthetic accessibility and their potential for ease of processing in further applications. The synthesized polymers reached thermal conductivities of 0.18–0.41 W/{mK}, which are comparable to those of state-of-the-art polymers in non-composite thermo-plastics.},

	abstract = {The emergence of “big data” initiatives has led to the need for tools that can automatically extract valuable chemical information from large volumes of unstructured data, such as the scientific literature. Since chemical information can be present in figures, tables, and textual paragraphs, successful information extraction often depends on the ability to interpret all of these domains simultaneously. We present a complete toolkit for the automated extraction of chemical entities and their associated properties, measurements, and relationships from scientific documents that can be used to populate structured chemical databases. Our system provides an extensible, chemistry-aware, natural language processing pipeline for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and phrase parsing. Within this scope, we report improved performance for chemical named entity recognition through the use of unsupervised word clustering based on a massive corpus of chemistry articles. For phrase parsing and information extraction, we present the novel use of multiple rule-based grammars that are tailored for interpreting specific document domains such as textual paragraphs, captions, and tables. We also describe document-level processing to resolve data interdependencies and show that this is particularly necessary for the autogeneration of chemical databases since captions and tables commonly contain chemical identifiers and references that are defined elsewhere in the text. The performance of the toolkit to correctly extract various types of data was evaluated, affording an F-score of 93.4\%, 86.8\%, and 91.5\% for extracting chemical identifiers, spectroscopic attributes, and chemical property attributes, respectively; set against the {CHEMDNER} chemical name extraction challenge, {ChemDataExtractor} yields a competitive F-score of 87.8\%.

	abstract = {The emerging field of materials informatics has the potential to greatly reduce time-to-market and development costs for new materials. The success of such efforts hinges on access to large, high-quality databases of material properties. However, many such data are only to be found encoded in text within esoteric scientific articles, a situation that makes automated extraction difficult and manual extraction time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we present a hybrid Information Extraction ({IE}) pipeline to improve the machine-human partnership with respect to extraction quality and person-hours, through a combination of rule-based, machine learning, and crowdsourcing approaches. Our goal is to leverage computer and human strengths to alleviate the burden on human curators by automating initial extraction tasks before prioritizing and assigning specialized curation tasks to humans with different levels of training: using non-experts for straightforward tasks such as validation of higher accuracy results (e.g., completing partial facts) and domain experts for low-certainty results (e.g., reviewing specialized compound labels). To validate our approaches, we focus on the task of extracting the glass transition temperature of polymers from published articles. Applying our approaches to 6 090 articles, we have so far extracted 259 refined data values. We project that this number will grow considerably as we tune our methods and process more articles, to exceed that found in standard, expert-curated polymer data handbooks while also being easier to keep up-to-date. The freely available data can be found on our Polymer Properties Predictor and Database website at http://pppdb.uchicago.edu.},

We show that two different tunneling models are consistent with the experiments. In the first model, the proton tunnels from the ground state. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect is caused by a thermally excited substrate mode that modulates the barrier, as has been suggested by Borgis and Hynes [Borgis, D. \& Hynes, J. T. (1991) J. Chem. Phys. 94, 3619–3628]. In the second model, there is both over-the-barrier transfer and tunneling from excited states.

Experiments show kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}) for some enzyme-catalysed hydrogen transfer reactions that deviate significantly from the limits imposed by considering the differences in mass of the isotopes alone (i.e. the semiclassical limit). These {KIEs} can be explained if the transfer of the hydrogen species occurs via a quantum mechanical tunnelling mechanism. The unusual temperature dependence of some {KIEs} has led to suggestions that enzymes have evolved to promote tunnelling through dynamics — a highly controversial hypothesis. Molecular simulations have a vital role in resolving these questions, providing a level of detail of analysis not possible through experiments alone. Here, we review computational molecular modelling studies of quantum tunnelling in enzymes, in particular focusing on the enzymes soybean lipoxygenase-1 ({SLO}-1), dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}), methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}) and aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}) to illustrate the current controversy regarding the importance of quantum effects in enzyme catalysis.},

The essential question is: do these complex motions have functional significance? In particular, how do they affect or relate to chemical reactions within enzymes, and how are chemical and conformational changes coupled together?

The purified enzyme catalyzed the oxidative deamination of various aromatic amines as well as some aliphatic amines to a lesser extent. An artificial electron acceptor such as phenazine methosulfate was required for the catalysis. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium was 103,000 and the molecule seemed to be composed of two pairs of two nonidentical subunits (Mr 46,000 and 8000). The enzyme had a dull yellow-green color with an absorption maximum at 445 nm and this chromophore appeared to be involved in the catalytic action of the enzyme.},

	abstract = {Aromatic amine dehydrogenase uses a tryptophan tryptophylquinone ({TTQ}) cofactor to oxidatively deaminate primary aromatic amines. In the reductive half-reaction, a proton is transferred from the substrate C1 {toβAsp}-128 O-2, in a reaction that proceeds by H-tunneling. Using solution studies, kinetic crystallography, and computational simulation we show that the mechanism of oxidation of aromatic carbinolamines is similar to amine oxidation, but that carbinolamine oxidation occurs at a substantially reduced rate. This has enabled us to determine for the first time the structure of the intermediate prior to the H-transfer/reduction step. The proton-βAsp-128 O-2 distance is ∼3.7Å,in contrast to the distance of ∼2.7Å predicted for the intermediate formed with the corresponding primary amine substrate. This difference of ∼1.0Å is due to an unexpected conformation of the substrate moiety, which is supported by molecular dynamic simulations and reflected in the ∼107-fold slower {TTQ} reduction rate with phenylaminoethanol compared with that with primary amines. A water molecule is observed near {TTQ} C-6 and is likely derived from the collapse of the preceding carbinolamine {TTQ}-adduct. We suggest this water molecule is involved in consecutive proton transfers following {TTQ} reduction, and is ultimately repositioned near the {TTQ} O-7 concomitant with protein rearrangement. For all carbinolamines tested, highly stable amide-{TTQ} adducts are formed following proton abstraction and {TTQ} reduction. Slow hydrolysis of the amide occurs after, rather than prior to, {TTQ} oxidation and leads ultimately to a carboxylic acid product.},

While models incorporating such promoting vibrations have successfully reproduced and explained experimental observations, it has also been argued that such vibrations are not part of the catalytic effect. In this study, we have employed combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical methods with molecular dynamics and potential energy surface calculations to investigate how enzyme and substrate motion affects the energy barrier to proton transfer for the rate-limiting H-transfer step in aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}) with tryptamine as substrate. In particular, the conformation of the iminoquinone adduct induced by {AADH} was found to be essential for a promoting vibration identified previously—this lowers significantly the ‘effective’ potential energy barrier, that is the barrier which remains to be surmounted following collective, thermally equilibrated motion attaining a quantum degenerate state of reactants and products. When the substrate adopts a conformation similar to that in the free iminoquinone, this barrier was found to increase markedly. This is consistent with {AADH} facilitating the H-transfer event by holding the substrate in a conformation that induces a promoting vibration.},

Nanomaterials research is frequently difficult to reproduce because of the complexity of the systems under study and a lack of standardization due to the exploratory nature of the field. One system that exemplifies this problem is that of the poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based organic field effect transistor, a platform used to study the process-structure-property relationships in semicrystalline polymeric semiconductors. Performance in this system is judged principally by charge carrier mobility, a fitted model parameter that describes how quickly charge can move through the active layer of a given transistor. Reported values of this electrical property vary by over six orders of magnitude for one material and are impacted by intrinsic material properties, processing conditions, device architectures and calculation methods. A database containing over 200 of these devices from 19 studies was compiled to demonstrate the impact of these parameters on reported performance as well as the utility of having such a database to search and explore. We confirm well-known trends such as the effect of polymer molecular weight, transistor channel length and thin film deposition method before going on to identify a standard device that can be compared across multiple studies. We find that an organized database of process-property information can be used to identify unpublished heuristic knowledge, to help authors standardize their reporting of methods, and to guide hypothesis generation and experimental design.

In this work, we identiﬁed seven monomers for use as either corona- or core-forming blocks during aqueous {ROMPISA} by in silico calculation of relative hydrophobicity for corresponding oligomeric models. The predicted monomers were validated experimentally by conducting {ROMPISA} using our previously reported two-step approach. In addition to predictive data, our computational model was exploited to identify trends between polymer hydrophobicity and the morphology of the self-assembled nano-objects they formed.

They are added to a polymer matrix ({PM}) following a given selected fraction (e.g., in terms of volume fraction ({VF})). In order to gain a deeper insight to model the mechanical properties of {PNCs}, the research teams have been modifying the existing micromechanics models (i.e. for two-phased {PNCs}) and finite element analysis ({FEA}) for microscale to nanoscale is being used. As a result, new formulations have been incorporated into commercial software packages to predict some properties of {PNCs} (e.g., elastic properties). Most recently, the modification of these models to three-phased {PNCs} has also been discussed. Some of the few studies already published on this subject show some difficulty for accurately modeling the interfacial region ({IR}), also known as interphase, between the matrix and the {NPs} in the {PNCs}. However, such studies also show that it is possible to capture some aspects of the real behavior of the {PNCs} (e.g., tensile modulus).

	abstract = {Nowadays, polymer reaction engineers seek robust and effective tools to synthesize complex macromolecules with well-defined and desirable microstructural and architectural characteristics. Over the past few decades, several promising approaches, such as controlled living (co)polymerization systems and chain-shuttling reactions have been proposed and widely applied to synthesize rather complex macromolecules with controlled monomer sequences. Despite the unique potential of the newly developed techniques, tailor-making the microstructure of macromolecules by suggesting the most appropriate polymerization recipe still remains a very challenging task. In the current work, two versatile and powerful tools capable of effectively addressing the aforementioned questions have been proposed and successfully put into practice. The two tools are established through the amalgamation of the Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach and machine learning techniques. The former, an intelligent modeling tool, is able to model and visualize the intricate inter-relationships of polymerization recipes/conditions (as input variables) and microstructural features of the produced macromolecules (as responses). The latter is capable of precisely predicting optimal copolymerization conditions to simultaneously satisfy all predefined microstructural features. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent modeling and optimization techniques for solving this extremely important \&lsquo;inverse\&rsquo; engineering problem was successfully examined by investigating the possibility of tailor-making the microstructure of Olefin Block Copolymers via chain-shuttling coordination polymerization.},

	abstract = {Having a compact yet robust structurally based identifier or representation system is a key enabling factor for efficient sharing and dissemination of research results within the chemistry community, and such systems lay down the essential foundations for future informatics and data-driven research. While substantial advances have been made for small molecules, the polymer community has struggled in coming up with an efficient representation system. This is because, unlike other disciplines in chemistry, the basic premise that each distinct chemical species corresponds to a well-defined chemical structure does not hold for polymers. Polymers are intrinsically stochastic molecules that are often ensembles with a distribution of chemical structures. This difficulty limits the applicability of all deterministic representations developed for small molecules. In this work, a new representation system that is capable of handling the stochastic nature of polymers is proposed. The new system is based on the popular “simplified molecular-input line-entry system” ({SMILES}), and it aims to provide representations that can be used as indexing identifiers for entries in polymer databases. As a pilot test, the entries of the standard data set of the glass transition temperature of linear polymers (Bicerano, 2002) were converted into the new {BigSMILES} language. Furthermore, it is hoped that the proposed system will provide a more effective language for communication within the polymer community and increase cohesion between the researchers within the community.},

A powerful {ANN} function is determined largely by the interconnections between artificial neurons, similar to those occurring in their natural counterparts of biological systems. Also in polymer composites, a certain amount of experimental results is required to train a well-designed neural network. After the network has learned to solve the material problems, new data from the similar domain can then be predicted without performing too many, long experiments. The objective of using {ANNs} is also to apply this tool for systematic parameter studies in the optimum design of composite materials for specific applications. In the present review, various principles of the neural network approach for predicting certain properties of polymer composite materials are discussed. These include fatigue life, wear performance, response under combined loading situations, and dynamic mechanical properties. Additionally, the {ANN} approach has been applied to composite processing optimizations. The goal of this review is to promote more consideration of using {ANNs} in the field of polymer composite property prediction and design.},

Here we use Monte Carlo tree search and symbolic artificial intelligence ({AI}) to discover retrosynthetic routes. We combined Monte Carlo tree search with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and a filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic steps. These deep neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our system solves for almost twice as many molecules, thirty times faster than the traditional computer-aided search method, which is based on extracted rules and hand-designed heuristics. In a double-blind {AB} test, chemists on average considered our computer-generated routes to be equivalent to reported literature routes.},

An improved understanding of the structural pathways and mechanisms by which self-assembling materials spontaneously form from their constituent building blocks is of value in understanding the fundamental principles of assembly and in guiding inverse building block design. We present an approach to infer systematically assembly pathways and mechanisms by nonlinear data mining of molecular simulation trajectories using diﬀusion maps. We have validated our methodology in applications to Brownian dynamics simulations of the assembly of anisotropic “patchy colloids” into polyhedral aggregates. For particles designed to form tetrahedral aggregates, we identify two divergent assembly pathways leading to chains of interlocking dimers and tetramers and chains of interlocking trigonal planar trimers. For particles designed to assemble icosahedral aggregates, our approach recovers two distinct assembly pathways corresponding to monomeric addition and budding from a disordered liquid phase. These assembly routes were previously reported by inspection of simulation trajectories by Wilber et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 127, 085106; J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 175102), validating the capacity of our approach to systematically recover assembly mechanisms previously discernible only by trajectory visualization.},

Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including quantitative structure activity relationship, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design, and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network-based models often exceeded the “glass ceiling” expectations of their respective tasks.

Polymers, being inexpensive and possessing a broad range of tunable properties, are widespread in many technological applications. The vast chemical and morphological complexity of polymers though gives rise to challenges in the rational discovery of new materials for specific applications. The nascent field of polymer informatics seeks to provide tools and pathways for accelerated property prediction (and materials design) via surrogate machine learning models built on reliable past data. We have carefully accumulated a data set of organic polymers whose properties were obtained either computationally (bandgap, dielectric constant, refractive index, and atomization energy) or experimentally (glass transition temperature, solubility parameter, and density). A fingerprinting scheme that captures atomistic to morphological structural features was developed to numerically represent the polymers. Machine learning models were then trained by mapping the fingerprints (or features) to properties. Once developed, these models can rapidly predict properties of new polymers (within the same chemical class as the parent data set) and can also provide uncertainties underlying the predictions. Since different properties depend on different length-scale features, the prediction models were built on an optimized set of features for each individual property. Furthermore, these models are incorporated in a user-friendly online platform named Polymer Genome (www.polymergenome.org). Systematic and progressive expansion of both chemical and property spaces are planned to extend the applicability of Polymer Genome to a wide range of technological domains.},

Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen-bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive Cα positions and is positive for right-handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β-sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue.

	abstract = {A versatile and practical method of searching a parameter space is presented. Theoretical and experimental results illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as the experimental optimization of the performance of a system with a very general multipeak performance function, when the only available information is noise-disturbed samples of the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to optimization with respect to one system parameter. The observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of the next observation may be interpreted as the location of the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate) for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown function, and the observations are interpreted with respect to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system optimization.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization has proven to be a highly effective methodology for the global optimization of unknown, expensive and multimodal functions. The ability to accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a flexible prior over functions which can be queried efficiently, there are various classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most frequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The optimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example by optimizing in "log-space," to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying length scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family of bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta cumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better results faster and more reliably.},

These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years.

Therefore, the {BioCreative} organizers posed the {CHEMDNER} (chemical compound and drug name recognition) community challenge, which promoted the development of novel, competitive and accessible chemical text mining systems. This task allowed a comparative assessment of the performance of various methodologies using a carefully prepared collection of manually labeled text prepared by specially trained chemists as Gold Standard data. We evaluated two important aspects: one covered the indexing of documents with chemicals (chemical document indexing - {CDI} task), and the other was concerned with finding the exact mentions of chemicals in text (chemical entity mention recognition - {CEM} task). 27 teams (23 academic and 4 commercial, a total of 87 researchers) returned results for the {CHEMDNER} tasks: 26 teams for {CEM} and 23 for the {CDI} task. Top scoring teams obtained an F-score of 87.39\% for the {CEM} task and 88.20\% for the {CDI} task, a very promising result when compared to the agreement between human annotators (91\%). The strategies used to detect chemicals included machine learning methods (e.g. conditional random fields) using a variety of features, chemistry and drug lexica, and domain-specific rules. We expect that the tools and resources resulting from this effort will have an impact in future developments of chemical text mining applications and will form the basis to find related chemical information for the detected entities, such as toxicological or pharmacogenomic properties.},

However, this abundance of data has brought new challenges, especially in curation. The role of biocurators is in part to filter research outcomes as they are generated, not only so that information is formatted and consolidated into locations that can provide long-term data sustainability, but also to ensure that the relevant data that was captured is reliable, reusable, and accessible. In many ways, biocuration lies somewhere between an art and a science. At {GrainGenes} (https://wheat.pw.usda.gov;https://graingenes.org), a long-time, stably-funded centralized repository for data about wheat, barley, rye, oat, and other small grains, curators have implemented a workflow for locating, parsing, and uploading new data so that the most important, peer-reviewed, high-quality research is available to users as quickly as possible with rich links to past research outcomes. In this report, we illustrate the principles and practical considerations of curation that we follow at {GrainGenes} with three case studies for curating a gene, a quantitative trait locus ({QTL}), and genomic elements. These examples demonstrate how our work allows users, i.e., small grains geneticists and breeders, to harness high-quality small grains data at {GrainGenes} to help them develop plants with enhanced agronomic traits.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the half-Cauchy distribution should replace the inverse-Gamma distribution as a default prior for a top-level scale parameter in Bayesian hierarchical models, at least for cases where a proper prior is necessary. Our arguments involve a blend of Bayesian and frequentist reasoning, and are intended to complement the case made by Gelman (2006) in support of folded-tt{\textless}math alttext="\$t\$" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}t{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} priors. First, we generalize the half-Cauchy prior to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on to prove a proposition that, together with the results for moments and marginals, allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These results, in turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the half-Cauchy prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies a sensible middle ground within this class: it performs well near the origin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts of the parameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justification for the routine use of this prior. We also consider situations where the underlying mean vector is sparse, where we argue that the usual conjugate choice of an inverse-gamma prior is particularly inappropriate, and can severely distort inference. Finally, we summarize some open issues in the specification of default priors for scale terms in hierarchical models.},

	abstract = {The hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression ({GPR}) model with a specified kernel are often estimated from the data via the maximum marginal likelihood. Due to the non-convexity of marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters, the optimisation may not converge to the global maxima. A common approach to tackle this issue is to use multiple starting points randomly selected from a specific prior distribution. As a result the choice of prior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this approach. However, there exists little research in the literature to study the impact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the performance of {GPR}. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study on this problem using simulated and real data experiments. We consider different types of priors for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonly used kernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the predictability of {GPR} models. The results reveal that, once a kernel is chosen, different priors for the initial hyperparameters have no significant impact on the performance of {GPR} prediction, despite that the estimates of the hyperparameters are very different to the true values in some cases.},

	abstract = {A wealth of valuable research data is locked within the millions of research articles published every year. Reading and extracting pertinent information from those articles has become an unmanageable task for scientists. Moreover, these data are loosely structured, encoded
in manuscripts of various formats, embedded in different content types, and are, in general, not machine accessible. Thus, studies that automatically leverage this valuable information are not tractable or even possible. Current approaches employ humans to manually extract data, define extraction rules, or annotate training corpora for machine learning approaches through tedious, time-consuming, error-prone and sometimes expensive processes. In the specific case of scientific information extraction, the need for pointed expertise increases costs and decreases the generalization of extraction methods. This thesis seeks to demonstrate that efficient combination of human-computer extraction techniques can considerably alleviate the burden on human curators, thereby speeding up discovery of new scientific facts and decreasing extraction costs. This thesis is investigated in the context of materials informatics, an emerging field that has the potential to greatly reduce time-to-market and development costs for new materials. Such efforts rely on access to large databases of material properties and therefore represent a suitable but not unique application for this research. This work addresses the challenge of populating a database of scientific facts by presenting three approaches with different levels of automation and human involvement. Specifically, these three approaches involve varying amount of untrained, trained and expert input in order to populate a database of polymer properties. The first effort, [Special character(s) omitted]{DB}, engages a semi-expert crowd to extract an important relation in polymer science. Here automation is limited, being concerned only with identifying appropriate elements of scientific articles to resent to crowd members. However, the approach is shown to accelerate data extraction speed considerably. [Special character(s) omitted]{DB} is a crowdsourcing system, which employs and assists a semi-expert crowd to extract an important relation in polymer science. Increasing the automation and targeting a different relation, the Tg approach is a pipeline that uses a variety of computer and human modules or tasks to supplement the output of a well-performing natural language processing software and prioritize expert curation. Having identified, named scientific named entity recognition as a major challenge and prerequisite for relations extraction, {polyNER}, the third approach uses minimal, focused expert knowledge to generate annotated entity-rich corpora data and bootstrap scientific named entities classifiers. This work shows that systems combining existing software and minimal human input can achieve performance comparable to that of a state-of-the-art domain-specific Natural Language Processing software and demonstrates the potential of hybrid human-computer partnership alternatives to sometimes impractical state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular graph convolutions, a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph—atoms, bonds, distances, etc.—which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement.},

Here, we first establish a database containing over 1700 donor materials reported in the literature. Through supervised learning, our machine learning ({ML}) models can build up the structure-property relationship and, thus, implement fast screening of {OPV} materials. We explore several expressions for molecule structures, i.e., images, {ASCII} strings, descriptors, and fingerprints, as inputs for various {ML} algorithms. It is found that fingerprints with length over 1000 bits can obtain high prediction accuracy. The reliability of our approach is further verified by screening 10 newly designed donor materials. Good consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that {ML} is a powerful tool to prescreen new {OPV} materials, thus accelerating the development of the {OPV} field.

We conducted molecular dynamics simulations of self-assembling synthetic oligopeptides with Asp-X -X -X - -X -X -X -Asp architectures. Dimerisation and trimerisation free energies were computed for a range of Asp-X -X -X amino acid sequences, and for perylenediimide ({PDI}) and naphthalenediimide ({NDI}) conjugated cores that mediate hydrophobic stacking and electron delocalisation within the self-assembled nanostructure. The larger {PDI} cores elevated oligomerisation free energies by a factor of 2-3 relative to {NDI} and also improved alignment of the oligopeptides within the stack. Training of a quantitative structure–property relationship ({QSPR}) model revealed key physicochemical determinants of the oligomerisation free energies and produced a predictive model for the oligomerisation thermodynamics. Oligopeptides with moderate dimerisation and trimerisation free energies of (-25) produced aggregates with the best in-register parallel stacking, and we used this criterion within our {QSPR} model to perform high-throughput virtual screening to identify promising candidates for the spontaneous assembly of ordered nanoaggregates. We identified a small number of oligopeptide candidates for direct testing in large scale molecular simulations, and predict a novel chemistry {DAVG}-{PDI}-{GVAD} previously unstudied by experiment or simulation to produce well-aligned nanoaggregates expected to possess good optical and electronic functionality.},

	abstract = {The aim of computational molecular design is the identification of promising hypothetical molecules with a predefined set of desired properties. We address the issue of accelerating the material discovery with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The method involves two different types of prediction; the forward and backward predictions. The objective of the forward prediction is to create a set of machine learning models on various properties of a given molecule. Inverting the trained forward models through Bayes’ law, we derive a posterior distribution for the backward prediction, which is conditioned by a desired property requirement. Exploring high-probability regions of the posterior with a sequential Monte Carlo technique, molecules that exhibit the desired properties can computationally be created. One major difficulty in the computational creation of molecules is the exclusion of the occurrence of chemically unfavorable structures. To circumvent this issue, we derive a chemical language model that acquires commonly occurring patterns of chemical fragments through natural language processing of {ASCII} strings of existing compounds, which follow the {SMILES} chemical language notation. In the backward prediction, the trained language model is used to refine chemical strings such that the properties of the resulting structures fall within the desired property region while chemically unfavorable structures are successfully removed. The present method is demonstrated through the design of small organic molecules with the property requirements on {HOMO}-{LUMO} gap and internal energy.

We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous wellknown artworks.

	abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classiﬁcation benchmarks have come from better conﬁgurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efﬁcient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and {GPU} processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can ﬁnd better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks ({DBNs}). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufﬁciently efﬁcient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training {DBNs}. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difﬁcult {DBN} learning problems from [1] and ﬁnd signiﬁcantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y{\textbar}x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm conﬁguration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the ﬁrst time to general algorithm conﬁguration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm conﬁguration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisﬁability problem ({SAT}), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming ({MIP}) solver {CPLEX}. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best conﬁguration approach.},

	abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method’s full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned. In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task ({LFW}), a face identification task ({PubFig}83) and an object recognition task ({CIFAR}-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

Fixed a bug where heatmap would ignore user-specified under/over/bad values when recentering a colormap. Fixed a bug where heatmap would use values from masked cells when computing default colormap limits. Fixed a bug where despine would cause an error when trying to trim spines on a matplotlib categorical axis. Adapted to a change in matplotlib that caused problems with single swarm plots. Added the showfliers parameter to boxenplot to suppress plotting of outlier data points, matching the {API} of boxplot. Avoided seeing an error from statmodels when data with an {IQR} of 0 is passed to kdeplot. Added the legend.title\_fontsize to the plotting\_context definition. Deprecated several utility functions that are no longer used internally (percentiles, sig\_stars, pmf\_hist, and sort\_df).},

	abstract = {This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a full set of {IPython} widgets that allow interactive selection of colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information. Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using different markers for different hues should let plots be more comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when printed). See the github pull request for examples. More generally, there is a new keyword argument in {FacetGrid} and {PairGrid}, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily. hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been added to {FacetGrid}. This allows for faceted plots with custom projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial {\textless}palette\_tutorial{\textgreater} for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets: choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette, choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information. Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the various choices one might make when choosing colors for their data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in {PairGrid} that gave incorrect results (or a crash) when the input {DataFrame} has a non-default index. Fixed a bug in {PairGrid} where passing columns with a date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2 arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric. Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value used in version 0.4 resulted in very large {PDF} files.},

Recently, it has been shown that the time-lagged independent component analysis ({TICA}) finds the linear combinations of input coordinates that optimally represent the slow kinetic modes and may serve in order to define reaction coordinates between the metastable states of the molecular system. A limitation of the method is that both computing time and memory requirements scale with the square of the number of input features. For large protein systems, this exacerbates the use of extensive feature sets such as the distances between all pairs of residues or even heavy atoms. Here we derive a hierarchical {TICA} ({hTICA}) method that approximates the full {TICA} solution by a hierarchical, divide-and-conquer calculation. By using {hTICA} on distances between heavy atoms we identify previously unknown relaxation processes in the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.},

It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The {CHARMM} program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with {CHARMM} can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original {CHARMM} article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

	abstract = {Aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}) and related enzymes are at the heart of debates on the roles of quantum tunneling and protein dynamics in catalysis. The reaction of tryptamine in {AADH} involves significant quantum tunneling in the rate-limiting proton transfer step, shown by large H/D primary kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}), with unusual temperature dependence. We apply correlated ab initio combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ({QM}/{MM}) methods, at levels up to local coupled cluster theory ({LCCSD}(T)/(aug)-cc-{pVTZ}), to calculate accurate potential energy surfaces for this reaction, which are necessary for quantitative analysis of tunneling contributions and reaction dynamics. Different levels of {QM}/{MM} treatment are tested. Multiple pathways are calculated with fully flexible transition state optimization by the climbing-image nudged elastic band method at the density functional {QM}/{MM} level. The average {LCCSD}(T) potential energy barriers to proton transfer are 16.7 and 14.0 kcal/mol for proton transfer to the two carboxylate atoms of the catalytic base, Asp128β. The results show that two similar, but distinct pathways are energetically accessible. These two pathways have different barriers, exothermicity and curvature, and should be considered in analyses of the temperature dependence of reaction and {KIEs} in {AADH} and other enzymes. These results provide a benchmark for this prototypical enzyme reaction and will be useful for developing empirical models, and analyzing experimental data, to distinguish between different conceptual models of enzyme catalysis.},

In this paper, we exploit the fact that a fully Bayesian analysis with Jeffreys non-informative prior distributions does not involve technical difficulty to propose an exact expression of the integrated complete-data likelihood, which is known as being a meaningful model selection criterion in a clustering perspective. Similarly, a Monte Carlo approximation of the integrated observed-data likelihood can be obtained in two steps: an exact integration over the parameters is followed by an approximation of the sum over all possible partitions through an importance sampling strategy. Then, the exact and the approximate criteria experimentally compete, respectively, with their standard asymptotic {BIC} approximations for choosing the number of mixture components. Numerical experiments on simulated data and a biological example highlight that asymptotic criteria are usually dramatically more conservative than the non-asymptotic presented criteria, not only for moderate sample sizes as expected but also for quite large sample sizes. This research highlights that asymptotic standard criteria could often fail to select some interesting structures present in the data.},

	abstract = {To compute a Bayes factor for testing H 0: ψ = ψ0 in the presence of a nuisance parameter β, priors under the null and alternative hypotheses must be chosen. As in Bayesian estimation, an important problem has been to define automatic, or “reference,” methods for determining priors based only on the structure of the model. In this article we apply the heuristic device of taking the amount of information in the prior on ψ equal to the amount of information in a single observation. Then, after transforming β to be “null orthogonal” to ψ, we take the marginal priors on β to be equal under the null and alternative hypotheses. Doing so, and taking the prior on ψ to be Normal, we find that the log of the Bayes factor may be approximated by the Schwarz criterion with an error of order O p (n −½), rather than the usual error of order O p (1). This result suggests the Schwarz criterion should provide sensible approximate solutions to Bayesian testing problems, at least when the hypotheses are nested. When instead the prior on ψ is elliptically Cauchy, a constant correction term must be added to the Schwarz criterion; the result then becomes a multidimensional generalization of Jeffreys's method.},

we derive simple analytic expressions for the reduced rate or Markov

times. These reduced Markovian models strike an optimal balance between
matching the dynamics at short and long times. We also discuss how
this approach can be used in a hierarchical procedure of constructing
optimal superstates through aggregation of microstates. The results
of the general reduced-matrix theory are illustrated with applications
to simple model systems and a more complex master-equation model of

We show two applications of the methodology: (i) to obtain a reduced dynamical model for a polypeptide dynamics in water and (ii) to identify diagnostic rules from a standard breast cancer dataset. For the first example, we show that the obtained reduced dynamical model can reproduce the full statistics of spatial molecular configurations—opening possibilities for a robust dimension and model reduction in molecular dynamics. For the breast cancer data, this methodology identifies a very simple diagnostics rule—free of any tuning parameters and exhibiting the same performance quality as the state of the art machine-learning applications with multiple tuning parameters reported for this problem.},

To identify these states, a conceptionally and computationally simple approach is proposed. It consists of (i) an initial preprocessing via principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by k-means clustering to generate up to 104 microstates, (ii) the most probable path algorithm to identify the metastable states of the system, and (iii) boundary corrections of these states via the introduction of cluster cores in order to obtain the correct dynamics. By adopting two well-studied model problems, hepta-alanine and the villin headpiece protein, the potential and the performance of the approach are demonstrated.},

After proper discretization, such conformations show up as almost invariant aggregates in reversible, nearly uncoupled Markov chains ({NUMCs}). Most of the former work on this subject treated the direct problem: given the aggregates, analyze the loose coupling in connection with the computation of the stationary distribution (aggregation/disaggregation techniques). In contrast to that, the present paper focuses on the inverse problem: given the system as a whole, identify the almost invariant aggregates together with the (small) probabilities of transitions between them. A robust algorithm is worked out on the basis of some detailed perturbation analysis and illustrated at a simple molecular system.},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs})–or discrete-time master equation models–are a powerful way of modeling the structure and function of molecular systems like proteins. Unfortunately, {MSMs} with sufficiently many states to make a quantitative connection with experiments (often tens of thousands of states even for small systems) are generally too complicated to understand. Here, I present a Bayesian agglomerative clustering engine ({BACE}) for coarse-graining such Markov models, thereby reducing their complexity and making them more comprehensible. An important feature of this algorithm is its ability to explicitly account for statistical uncertainty in model parameters that arises from finite sampling. This advance builds on a number of recent works highlighting the importance of accounting for uncertainty in the analysis of {MSMs} and provides significant advantages over existing methods for coarse-graining Markov state models. The closed-form expression I derive here for determining which states to merge is equivalent to the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence, an important measure from information theory that is related to the relative entropy. Therefore, the method has an appealing information theoretic interpretation in terms of minimizing information loss. The bottom-up nature of the algorithm likely makes it particularly well suited for constructing mesoscale models. I also present an extremely efficient expression for Bayesian model comparison that can be used to identify the most meaningful levels of the hierarchy of models from {BACE}.},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}) have become a popular approach for investigating the conformational dynamics of proteins and other biomolecules. {MSMs} are typically built from numerous molecular dynamics simulations by dividing the sampled configurations into a large number of microstates based on geometric criteria. The resulting microstate model can then be coarse-grained into a more understandable macrostate model by lumping together rapidly mixing microstates into larger, metastable aggregates. However, finite sampling often results in the creation of many poorly sampled microstates. During coarse-graining, these states are mistakenly identified as being kinetically important because transitions to/from them appear to be slow. In this paper, we propose a formalism based on an algebraic principle for matrix approximation, i.e., the Nyström method, to deal with such poorly sampled microstates. Our scheme builds a hierarchy of microstates from high to low populations and progressively applies spectral clustering on sets of microstates within each level of the hierarchy. It helps spectral clustering identify metastable aggregates with highly populated microstates rather than being distracted by lowly populated states. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to discover the major metastable states on two model systems, the alanine dipeptide and trpzip2 peptide.},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}) provide some of the simplest mathematical and physical descriptions of dynamical and thermodynamical properties of complex systems. However, typically, the large dimensionality of biological systems studied makes them prohibitively expensive to work in fully Markovian regimes. In this case, coarse graining can be introduced to capture the key dynamical processes—slow degrees of the system—and reduce the dimension of the problem. Here, we introduce several possible options for such Markovian coarse graining, including previously commonly used choices: the local equilibrium and the Hummer Szabo approaches. We prove that the coarse grained lower dimensional {MSM} satisfies a variational principle with respect to its slowest relaxation time scale. This provides an excellent framework for optimal coarse graining, as previously demonstrated. Here, we show that such optimal coarse graining to two or three states has a simple physical interpretation in terms of mean first passage times and fluxes between the coarse grained states. The results are verified numerically using both analytic test potentials and data from explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of pentalanine. This approach of optimizing and interpreting clustering protocols has broad applicability and can be used in time series analysis of large data.},

	abstract = {The accurate definition of suitable metastable conformational states is fundamental for the construction of a Markov state model describing biomolecular dynamics. Following the dimensionality reduction in a molecular dynamics trajectory, these microstates can be generated by a recently proposed density-based geometrical clustering algorithm [F. Sittel and G. Stock, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12, 2426 (2016)], which by design cuts the resulting clusters at the energy barriers and allows for a data-based identification of all parameters. Nevertheless, projection artifacts due to the inevitable restriction to a low-dimensional space combined with insufficient sampling often leads to a misclassification of sampled points in the transition regions. This typically causes intrastate fluctuations to be mistaken as interstate transitions, which leads to artificially short life times of the metastable states. As a simple but effective remedy, dynamical coring requires that the trajectory spends a minimum time in the new state for the transition to be counted. Adopting molecular dynamics simulations of two well-established biomolecular systems (alanine dipeptide and villin headpiece), dynamical coring is shown to considerably improve the Markovianity of the resulting metastable states, which is demonstrated by Chapman-Kolmogorov tests and increased implied time scales of the Markov model. Providing high structural and temporal resolution, the combination of density-based clustering and dynamical coring is particularly suited to describe the complex structural dynamics of unfolded biomolecules.},

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.

Among 504 scale-score and raw-score distributions from state testing programs from recent years, nonnormal distributions are common and are often associated with particular state programs. The authors explain how scaling procedures from item response theory lead to nonnormal distributions as well as unusual patterns of discreteness.

	abstract = {In randomised trials, continuous endpoints are often measured with some degree of error. This study explores the impact of ignoring measurement error and proposes methods to improve statistical inference in the presence of measurement error. Three main types of measurement error in continuous endpoints are considered: classical, systematic, and differential. For each measurement error type, a corrected effect estimator is proposed. The corrected estimators and several methods for confidence interval estimation are tested in a simulation study. These methods combine information about error-prone and error-free measurements of the endpoint in individuals not included in the trial (external calibration sample). We show that, if measurement error in continuous endpoints is ignored, the treatment effect estimator is unbiased when measurement error is classical, while Type-{II} error is increased at a given sample size. Conversely, the estimator can be substantially biased when measurement error is systematic or differential. In those cases, bias can largely be prevented and inferences improved upon using information from an external calibration sample, of which the required sample size increases as the strength of the association between the error-prone and error-free endpoint decreases. Measurement error correction using already a small (external) calibration sample is shown to improve inferences and should be considered in trials with error-prone endpoints. Implementation of the proposed correction methods is accommodated by a new software package for R.},

To this end, we investigated the conformational dynamics of two key Arabidopsis thaliana receptor-like kinases, brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 ({BRI}1) and {BRI}1-associated kinase 1 ({BAK}1), through extensive molecular dynamics simulations of their fully phosphorylated kinase domains. Molecular dynamics simulations calculate the motion of each atom in a protein based on classical approximations of interatomic forces, giving researchers insight into protein function at unparalleled spatial and temporal resolutions. We found that in an otherwise “active” {BAK}1 the αC helix is highly disordered, a hallmark of deactivation, whereas the {BRI}1 αC helix is moderately disordered and displays swinging behavior similar to numerous animal kinases.

	abstract = {The dopamine transporter ({DAT}) belongs to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter ({NSS}) family of membrane proteins that are responsible for reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft to terminate a neuronal signal and enable subsequent neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron. The release of one sodium ion from the crystallographically determined sodium binding site Na2 had been identified as an initial step in the transport cycle which prepares the transporter for substrate translocation by stabilizing an inward-open conformation. We have constructed Markov State Models ({MSMs}) from extensive molecular dynamics simulations of human {DAT} ({hDAT}) to explore the mechanism of this sodium release. Our results quantify the release process triggered by hydration of the Na2 site that occurs concomitantly with a conformational transition from an outward-facing to an inward-facing state of the transporter. The kinetics of the release process are computed from the {MSM}, and transition path theory is used to identify the most probable sodium release pathways. An intermediate state is discovered on the sodium release pathway, and the results reveal the importance of various modes of interaction of the N-terminus of {hDAT} in controlling the pathways of release.},

The essentiality of the enzyme to bacteria, coupled with its absence in humans, validates {DHDPS} as an antibacterial drug target. Conventional drug design efforts have thus far been unsuccessful in identifying potent {DHDPS} inhibitors. Here, we make use of contemporary molecular dynamics simulation and Markov state models to explore the interactions between {DHDPS} from the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and its cognate substrate, pyruvate. Our simulations recover the crystallographic {DHDPS}-pyruvate complex without a priori knowledge of the final bound structure. The highly conserved residue Arg140 was found to have a pivotal role in coordinating the entry of pyruvate into the active site from bulk solvent, consistent with previous kinetic reports, indicating an indirect role for the residue in {DHDPS} catalysis. A metastable binding intermediate characterized by multiple points of intermolecular interaction between pyruvate and key {DHDPS} residue Arg140 was found to be a highly conserved feature of the binding trajectory when comparing alternative binding pathways. By means of umbrella sampling we show that these binding intermediates are thermodynamically metastable, consistent with both the available experimental data and the substrate binding model presented in this study. Our results provide insight into an important enzyme-substrate interaction in atomistic detail that offers the potential to be exploited for the discovery of more effective {DHDPS} inhibitors and, in a broader sense, dynamic protein-drug interactions.},

Herein, we studied the unfolding pathway of {TBA} by a combination of molecular dynamics simulation ({MD}) and Markov State Model ({MSM}). Our results revealed that the unfolding of {TBA} is not a simple two-state process but proceeds along multiple pathways with multistate intermediates. One high flux confirms some observations from {NMR} experiment. Another high flux exhibits a different and simpler unfolding pathway with less intermediates. Two important intermediate states were identified. One is similar to the G-triplex reported in the folding of G-quadruplex, but lack of H-bonding between guanines in the upper plane. More importantly, another intermediate state acting as a connector to link the folding region and the unfolding one, was the first time identified, which exhibits higher population and stability than the G-triplex-like intermediate.

Many experimental and simulation studies suggest that disordered domains such as p53 {TAD} bind their targets nonspecifically before folding to a tightly associated conformation, but the microscopic details are unclear. Toward a detailed prediction of binding mechanisms, pathways, and rates, we have performed large-scale unbiased all-atom simulations of p53-{MDM}2 binding. Markov state models ({MSMs}) constructed from the trajectory data predict p53 {TAD} binding pathways and on-rates in good agreement with experiment. The {MSM} reveals that two key bound intermediates, each with a nonnative arrangement of hydrophobic residues in the {MDM}2 binding cleft, control the overall on-rate. Using microscopic rate information from the {MSM}, we parameterize a simple four-state kinetic model to 1) determine that induced-fit pathways dominate the binding flux over a large range of concentrations, and 2) predict how modulation of residual p53 helicity affects binding, in good agreement with experiment. These results suggest new ways in which microscopic models of peptide binding, coupled with simple few-state binding flux models, can be used to understand biological function in physiological contexts.},

            Elucidating conformational heterogeneity of proteins is essential for understanding protein functions and developing exogenous ligands for chemical perturbation. While structural biology methods can provide atomic details of static protein structures, these approaches cannot in general resolve less populated, functionally relevant conformations and uncover conformational kinetics. Here we demonstrate a new paradigm for illuminating dynamic conformational landscapes of target proteins. {SETD}8 (Pr-{SET}7/{SET}8/{KMT}5A) is a biologically relevant protein lysine methyltransferase for

            monomethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 and nonhistone targets. Utilizing covalent chemical inhibitors and depleting native ligands to trap hidden high-energy conformational states, we obtained diverse novel X-ray structures of {SETD}8. These structures were used to seed massively distributed molecular simulations that generated six milliseconds of trajectory data of {SETD}8 in the presence or absence of its cofactor. We used an automated machine learning approach to reveal slow conformational motions and thus distinct conformational states of {SETD}8, and validated the resulting dynamic conformational landscapes with multiple biophysical methods. The resulting models provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics plays a role in {SAM} binding and thus catalysis, and how this function can be modulated by diverse cancer-associated mutants. These findings set up the foundation for revealing enzymatic mechanisms and developing inhibitors in the context of conformational landscapes of target proteins.},

We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly-in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time-from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

In the absence of bias, the {FMI} was a better guide to the efficiency gains using {MI} than the proportion of missing data. {CONCLUSION} We provide evidence that for {MAR} data, valid {MI} reduces bias even when the proportion of missingness is large.

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}) have been successful in computing metastable states, slow relaxation timescales and associated structural changes, and stationary or kinetic experimental observables of complex molecules from large amounts of molecular dynamics simulation data. However, {MSMs} approximate the true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of {MSMs} has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models ({PMMs}). Robust estimation methods for {PMMs} are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models ({HMMs}). It is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed from {MSMs} can be computed from {HMMs}/{PMMs}. The new framework is applicable to both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its versatility by applications to educative model systems, a 1 ms Anton {MD} simulation of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory of an {RNA} hairpin.},

The hypotheses the statistician tests exist in a world of black and white, where the alternatives are clear, simple, and few in number, whereas the scientist works in a vast gray area in which the alternative hypotheses are often confusing, complex, and limited in number only by the scientist's ingenuity. The present paper is concerned with just one feature of this distinction, namely, that when a statistician rejects the null hypothesis at a certain level of confidence, say .05, he may then be fairly well assured (p = .95) that the alternative statistical hypothesis is correct. However, when a scientist runs the same rest, using the same numbers, rejecting the same null hypothesis, he cannot in general conclude with p = .95 that his scientific hypothesis is correct. In assessing the probability of his hypothesis he is also obliged to consider the probability char the statistical model he assumed for purposes of the test is really applicable. The staciscician can say "if the distribution is normal," or "zf we assume the parent ppulation is distributed exponentially." These ifs cost the statistician nothing, but they can prove to be quite a burden on the poor E whose numbers represent controlled observations nor just symbols written on paper. The scientist also has che burden of judging whether his hypothesis has a greater probability of being correct than other hypotheses that could also explain his data. The stacistician is confronted with just two hypotheses, and the decision which he makes is only between these two. Suppose he has two samples and is concerned with whether the two means differ. The observed difference can be attributed either to random variation (the null hypothesis) or to the alternative hypochesis that the samples have been drawn from two populations with different means. Ordinarily these two alternatives exhaust the statistician's universe. The scientist, on the other hand, being ultimately concerned with the nature of natural phenomena, has only started his work when he rejects the null hypothesis. An example may help to illustrate these rwo points. Consider the following situation.

In tracing the evolution of these lines of attack some important landmarks stand out: van't Hoff s thermodynamic approach involving enthalpy changes followed by Marcelin's treatment in terms of affinity and subsequent developments by Kohnstamm, Scheffer, and others; Trautz's and Lewis's hard-sphere collision theories; Marcelin's statistical-mechanical treatment, made more precise by Rice, and later treatments of Herzfeld, Eyring, Polanyi, and Pelzer and Wigner. Transition-state theory, by focusing attention on the activated complexes which are assumed to be in "quasi-equilibrium" with reactants, provides a simple way of formulating reaction rates and gives a unique insight into how processes occur. It has survived considerable criticisms and after almost 50 years has not been replaced by any general treatment comparable in simplicity and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Two of the most successful methods that are presently available for simulating the quantum dynamics of condensed phase systems are centroid molecular dynamics ({CMD}) and ring polymer molecular dynamics ({RPMD}). Despite their conceptual differences, practical implementations of these methods differ in just two respects: the choice of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix and whether or not a thermostat is applied to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. Here, we explore a method which is halfway between the two approximations: we keep the path integral bead masses equal to the physical particle masses but attach a Langevin thermostat to the internal modes of the ring polymer during the dynamics. We justify this by showing analytically that the inclusion of an internal mode thermostat does not affect any of the established features of {RPMD}: thermostatted {RPMD} is equally valid with respect to everything that has actually been proven about the method as {RPMD} itself. In particular, because of the choice of bead masses, the resulting method is still optimum in the short-time limit, and the transition state approximation to its reaction rate theory remains closely related to the semiclassical instanton approximation in the deep quantum tunneling regime. In effect, there is a continuous family of methods with these properties, parameterised by the strength of the Langevin friction. Here, we explore numerically how the approximation to quantum dynamics depends on this friction, with a particular emphasis on vibrational spectroscopy. We find that a broad range of frictions approaching optimal damping give similar results, and that these results are immune to both the resonance problem of {RPMD} and the curvature problem of {CMD}.},

Here, we tackle this question by comparing an enzyme with its heavy (15 N, 13 C, 2 H substituted) counterpart, providing a subtle probe of dynamics. The crucial hydride trans-fer step of the reaction (the chemical step) occurs more slowly in the heavy enzyme. A combination of experimental results, quan-tum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations, and theoretical analyses identify the origins of the observed differences in reac-tivity. The generally slightly slower reaction in the heavy enzyme reflects differences in environmental coupling to the hydride transfer step. Importantly, the barrier and contribution of quan-tum tunneling are not affected, indicating no significant role for " promoting motions " in driving tunneling or modulating the bar-rier. The chemical step is slower in the heavy enzyme because protein motions coupled to the reaction coordinate are slower. The fact that the heavy enzyme is only slightly less active than its light counterpart shows that protein dynamics have a small, but measurable, effect on the chemical reaction rate. kinetics {\textbar} computational chemistry {\textbar} biological chemistry {\textbar} biophysics {\textbar}},

	abstract = {Enzyme catalysis is central to almost all biochemical processes, speeding up rates of reactions to biological relevant timescales. Enzymes make use of a large ensemble of conformations in recognizing their substrates and stabilizing the transition states, due to the inherent dynamical nature of biomolecules. The exact role of these diverse enzyme conformations and the interplay between enzyme conformational dynamics and catalysis is, according to the literature, not well understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study human cyclophilin A ({CypA}), in order to understand the role of enzyme motions in the catalytic mechanism and recognition. Cyclophilin A is a tractable model system to study using classical simulation methods, because catalysis does not involve bond formation or breakage. We show that the conformational dynamics of active site residues of substrate-bound {CypA} is inherent in the substrate-free enzyme. {CypA} interacts with its substrate via conformational selection as the configurations of the substrate changes during catalysis. We also show that, in addition to tight intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between {CypA} and the substrate, an intricate enzyme-substrate intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network is extremely sensitive to the configuration of the substrate. These enzyme-substrate intermolecular interactions are loosely formed when the substrate is in the reactant and product states and become well formed and reluctant to break when the substrate is in the transition state. Our results clearly suggest coupling among enzyme-substrate intermolecular interactions, the dynamics of the enzyme, and the chemical step. This study provides further insights into the mechanism of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases and the general interplay between enzyme conformational dynamics and catalysis. ?? 2013 Biophysical Society.},

Experimental findings support a hierarchy of thermodynamically equilibrated motions that control the H-donor and -acceptor distance and active-site electrostatics, creating an ensemble of conformations suitable for H-tunneling. A possible extension of this view to methyl transfer and other catalyzed reactions is also presented.

	abstract = {At physiological temperatures, enzymes exhibit a broad spectrum of conformations, which interchange via thermally activated dynamics. These conformations are sampled differently in different complexes of the protein and its ligands, and the dynamics of exchange between these conformers depends on the mass of the group that is moving and the length scale of the motion, as well as restrictions imposed by the globular fold of the enzymatic complex. Many of these motions have been examined and their role in the enzyme function illuminated, yet most experimental tools applied so far have identified dynamics at time scales of seconds to nanoseconds, which are much slower than the time scale for H-transfer between two heavy atoms. This chemical conversion and other processes involving cleavage of covalent bonds occur on picosecond to femtosecond time scales, where slower processes mask both the kinetics and dynamics. Here we present a combina- tion of kinetic and spectroscopic methods that may enable closer examination of the relationship between enzymatic C–H ! C transfer and the dynamics of the active site environment at the chemically relevant time scale. Thesemethods include kinetic isotope effects and their temperature dependence, which are used to study the kinetic nature of {theH}-transfer, and 2DIRspectroscopy, which is used to study the dynamics of transition-state- and ground-state-analog complexes.

Pin1 specifically catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds preceded by phosphorylated serine or phosphorylated threonine in its protein substrates. Yet, little is known about the catalytic mechanism of Pin1 in atomistic detail. Here, we present results from accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to show that catalysis occurs along a restricted path of the backbone configuration of the substrate, selecting out specific conformations of the substrate in the active site of Pin1. We show that the dynamics of Pin1 and the enzyme-substrate interactions are intricately coupled to isomerization during catalysis. The strength of the interactions between the phosphate binding pocket of Pin1 and the phosphate moiety of the substrate is dictated by the state of the substrate during catalysis. We also show that the transition-state configuration of the substrate binds better than the cis and trans states to the catalytic domain of Pin1, suggesting that Pin1 catalyzes its substrate by noncovalently stabilizing the transition state. These results suggest an atomistic detail understanding of the catalytic mechanism of Pin1 that is necessary for the design of novel inhibitors and the treatment of several diseases.},

In the course of evolution, nature optimized numerous mechanisms to use glutathione as the most versatile nucleophile for the conversion of a plethora of sulfur-, oxygen- or carbon-containing electrophilic substances. Scope of review: This comprehensive review summarizes fundamental principles of glutathione catalysis and compares the structures and mechanisms of glutathione-dependent enzymes, including glutathione reductase, glutaredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, glyoxalases 1 and 2, glutathione transferases and {MAPEG}. Moreover, open mechanistic questions, evolutionary aspects and the physiological relevance of glutathione catalysis are discussed for each enzyme family. Major conclusions: It is surprising how little is known about many glutathione-dependent enzymes, how often reaction geometries and acid-base catalysts are neglected, and how many mechanistic puzzles remain unsolved despite almost a century of research. On the one hand, several enzyme families with non-related protein folds recognize the glutathione moiety of their substrates. On the other hand, the thioredoxin fold is often used for glutathione catalysis. Ancient as well as recent structural changes of this fold did not only significantly alter the reaction mechanism, but also resulted in completely different protein functions. General significance: Glutathione-dependent enzymes are excellent study objects for structure-function relationships and molecular evolution. Notably, in times of systems biology, the outcome of models on glutathione metabolism and redox regulation is more than questionable as long as fundamental enzyme properties are neither studied nor understood. Furthermore, several of the presented mechanisms could have implications for drug development.

Like other iron/2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases, {AlkB} employs a two-step mechanism in which oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate generates a highly reactive enzyme-bound oxyferryl intermediate that, in the case of {AlkB}, slowly hydroxylates an alkylated nucleobase. Our results demonstrate that a microsecond-to-millisecond timescale conformational transition facilitates the proper sequential order of substrate binding to {AlkB}. Mutations altering the dynamics of this transition allow generation of the oxyferryl intermediate, but promote its premature quenching by solvent, which uncouples 2-oxoglutarate turnover from nucleobase oxidation. Therefore, efficient catalysis by {AlkB} depends upon the dynamics of a specific conformational transition, establishing another paradigm for the control of enzyme function by protein dynamics.},

We find that the theory fits the experimental data rather well. The effects of different mutants are readily interpreted in terms of the friction they exert on the reaction center.

However, very little is understood about the connection of these functionally relevant, collective movements with local atomic fluctuations, which are much faster. Here we show that pico- to nano-second timescale atomic fluctuations in hinge regions of adenylate kinase facilitate the large-scale, slower lid motions that produce a catalytically competent state. The fast, local mobilities differ between a mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinase, but are strikingly similar at temperatures at which enzymatic activity and free energy of folding are matched. The connection between different timescales and the corresponding amplitudes of motions in adenylate kinase and their linkage to catalytic function is likely to be a general characteristic of protein energy landscapes.},

We review the theoretical background and algorithmic realization of {MSMs} and illustrate their use by some numerical examples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to using {MSMs} for the efficient solution of optimal control problems that appear in applications where one desires to optimize molecular properties by means of external controls.},

	abstract = {Many biological C-H activation reactions exhibit nonclassical kinetic isotope effects ({KIEs}). These nonclassical {KIEs} are too large ({kH}/{kD} {\textbackslash}textgreater 7) and/or exhibit unusual temperature dependence such that the Arrhenius prefactor {KIEs} ({AH}/{AD}) fall outside of the semiclassical range near unity. The focus of this minireview is to discuss such {KIEs} within the context of the environmentally coupled hydrogen tunneling model. Full tunneling models of hydrogen transfer assume that protein or solvent fluctuations generate a reactive configuration along the classical, heavy-atom coordinate, from which the hydrogen transfers via nuclear tunneling. Environmentally coupled tunneling also invokes an environmental vibration (gating) that modulates the tunneling barrier, leading to a temperature-dependent {KIE}. These properties directly link enzyme fluctuations to the reaction coordinate for hydrogen transfer, making a quantum view of hydrogen transfer necessarily a dynamic view of catalysis. The environmentally coupled hydrogen tunneling model leads to a range of magnitudes of {KIEs}, which reflect the tunneling barrier, and a range of {AH}/{AD} values, which reflect the extent to which gating modulates hydrogen transfer. Gating is the primary determinant of the temperature dependence of the {KIE} within this model, providing insight into the importance of this motion in modulating the reaction coordinate. The potential use of variable temperature {KIEs} as a direct probe of coupling between environmental dynamics and the reaction coordinate is described. The evolution from application of a tunneling correction to a full tunneling model in enzymatic H transfer reactions is discussed in the context of a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase and soybean lipoxygenase-1.},

Hydrogen tunnelling, coupling between the tunnel modes and the environment, and fluctuational barrier preparation for hydrogen tunnelling are in focus and given precise analytical forms. Specific rate constants are provided for three limits, i.e., the fully diabatic, the partially adiabatic, and the fully adiabatic limits. These limits are all likely to represent real chemical or biological hydrogen transfer systems. The rate constants are referred particularly to the driving force and temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect ({KIE}). The origin of these correlations is different in the three limits. It is rooted in the tunnel factor and weak excitation of the heavier isotopes in the former two limits, giving a maximum for thermoneutral processes. A new observation is that the adiabatic limit also accords with a {KIE} maximum for thermoneutral processes but the {KIE} is here reflected solely in the activation Gibbs free energy differences, in this case rooted in the low-frequency environmental nuclear dynamics. Three systems of biological hydrogen tunnelling, viz. lipoxygenase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, and bovine serum amine oxygenase, offer unusual new cases for analysis and have been analysed using the theoretical frames. All the systems show large {KIEs} and strong indications of hydrogen tunnelling. They also represent different degrees of fluctuational barrier preparation, with lipoxygenase as the most rigid and bovine serum amine oxygenase as the softest system.},

An application of the method to the standard model for a chemical reaction in solution–a quartic double-well potential linearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators–is found to give results of comparable accuracy to those of the classical Wigner model and the centroid molecular dynamics method. However, since the present method does not require that one evaluate the Wigner transform of a thermal flux operator or that one perform a separate path integral calculation for each molecular dynamics time step, we believe it will prove easier to apply to more general problems than either of these alternative techniques. We also present a (logarithmic) discretization scheme for the Ohmic bath in the system-bath model that gives converged results with just nine bath modes–a surprisingly small number for a model of a condensed phase reaction. Finally, we present some calculations of the transmission through an Eckart barrier which show that the present method provides a satisfactory (although not perfect) description of the deep quantum tunneling regime. Part of the reason for the success of the method is that it gives the exact quantum-mechanical rate constant for the transmission through a parabolic barrier, as we demonstrate analytically in the Appendix.},

The flexible Cu–{SMet} bond is well reproduced in the oxidized structures,whereas it is too long in some of the reduced complexes (too short in vacuum). The change in the geometry compared to the vacuum state costs 33–66 {kJ}/mol. If the covalent bonds between the ligands and the protein are broken, this energy decreases by ∼25 {kJ}/mol,which is an estimate of the covalent strain. This is similar towhat is found for other proteins, so the blue copper proteins are notmore strained than othermetalloproteins. The inner-sphere self-exchange reorganization energy of all four proteins are ∼30 {kJ}/mol. This is 30–50 {kJ}/mol lower than in vacuum.

The method considers the complete enzyme-substrate complex together with the surrounding solvent and evaluates all the different quantum mechanical and classical energy factors that can affect the reaction pathway. These factors include the quantum mechanical energies associated with bond cleavage and charge redistribution of the substrate and the classical energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. The electrostatic polarization of the enzyme atoms and the orientation of the dipoles of the surrounding water molecules is simulated by a microscopic dielectric model. The solvation energy resulting from this polarization is considerable and must be included in any realistic calculation of chemical reactions involving anything more than an isolated molecule in vacuo. Without it, acidic groups can never become ionized and the charge distribution on the substrate will not be reasonable. The same dielectric model can also be used to study the reaction of the substrate in solution. In this way the reaction in solution can be compared with the enzymic reaction. In this paper we study the stability of the carbonium ion intermediate formed in the cleavage of a glycosidic bond by lysozyme. It is found that electrostatic stabilization is an important factor in increasing the rate of the reaction step that leads to the formation of the carbonium ion intermediate. Steric factors, such as the strain of the substrate on binding to lysozyme, do not seem to contribute significantly.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

Changes to the composition of the reaction medium are known to perturb protein motions. We have measured kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed by {DHFR} from Escherichia coli in the presence of various cosolvents and cosolutes and show that the dielectric constant, but not the viscosity, of the reaction medium affects the rate of reaction. Neither the primary kinetic isotope effect on the reaction nor its temperature dependence were affected by changes to the bulk solvent properties. These results are in agreement with our previous report on the effect of solvent composition on catalysis by {DHFR} from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. However, the effect of solvent on the temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect on hydride transfer catalyzed by E. coli {DHFR} is difficult to explain within a model, in which long-range motions couple to the chemical step of the reaction, but may indicate the existence of a short-range promoting vibration or the presence of multiple nearly isoenergetic conformational substates of enzymes with similar but distinct catalytic properties.},

The data provide direct experimental evidence for enzymatic bond breakage by extreme tunneling driven by vibrational motion of the protein scaffold. The results demonstrate that classical transition state theory and its tunneling derivatives do not adequately describe this enzymatic reaction.},

Focusing on 2-deoxyglucose to probe the chemical step, we have now measured the temperature dependence of competitive H/T and D/T kinetic isotope effects and the enthalpy of activation using [1-2H]-2-deoxyglucose. The D/T isotope effect on the Arrhenius preexponential factor ({AD}/{AT}) is 1.47 (+/-0.09), 1.30 (+/-0.10), and 0.89 (+/-0.04) for the 136, 155, and 205 {kDa} glycoforms, respectively. The value obtained for the 136 {kDa} glycoform is well above the range expected for semiclassical-classical (no tunneling) reactions (upper limit of 1.22). The abnormal A(D)/A(T) is rationalized by extensive tunneling. The enthalpies of activation are 8.1 (+/-0.4), 11.0 (+/-0.3), and 13.7 (+/-0.3) kcal/mol for the 136, 155, and 205 {kDa} glycoforms, respectively. Apparently, less glycosylation results in more tunneling and a lower enthalpy of activation. The crystal structure, kinetic analysis, and other studies suggest that the enzyme active site is not conformationally changed by the degree of glycosylation. Hence, the differences among the glycoforms, which indicate that changes in the enzyme polysaccharide envelope lead to a significant change in the nature of the hydrogen transfer step, suggest a dynamic transmission of protein surface effects to the active site.},

Secondary H/T and D/T kinetic effects are small and in the range anticipated from equilibrium isotope effects; Arrhenius preexponential factors ({AH}/{AT} and {AD}/{AT}) determined from the temperature dependence of isotope effects also indicate semiclassical behavior. By contrast, primary H/T and D/T isotope effects, 35.2 +/- 0.8 and 3.07 +/- 0.07, respectively, at 25 degrees C, are larger than semiclassical values and give anomalously low preexponential factor ratios, {AH}/{AT} = 0.12 +/- 0.04 and {AD}/{AT} = 0.51 +/- 0.10. Stopped-flow studies indicate similar isotope effects on cofactor reduction as seen in the steady state, consistent with a single rate-limiting C-H bond cleavage step for Vmax/Km. The comparison of primary and secondary isotope effects allows us to rule out appreciable coupling between the primary and secondary hydrogens at C-1 of the substrate. From the properties of primary isotope effects, we conclude that both protium and deuterium undergo significant tunneling in the course of substrate oxidation.

At {pH} 7.5, exponents relating observed {kH}/{kT} and {kD}/{kT} isotope effects indicate the presence of a temperature-dependent change in rate-limiting step. At lower temperature (e.g., 2 degrees C), the presence of multiple rate-limiting steps (commitments) is clearly indicated from the size of the exponent and individual isotope effects. Noncompetitive {kH}/{kD} isotope effect measurements indicate a trend in observed isotope effects between {pH} 9.0 and 6.0, with isotope effects increasing at lower {pH}. Primary and secondary {kH}/{kT} and {kD}/{kT} isotope effects were therefore measured as a function of temperature at {pH} 6.1. Exponents relating primary and secondary {kH}/{kT} and {kD}/{kT} in the 10-43 degrees C range are 3.13 +/- 0.04 and 2.36 +/- 0.13, respectively, and do not systematically change with temperature. These data indicate that commitments, if present, remain constant across this temperature range. The temperature dependence of the observed primary isotope effects gives values for the ratios of Arrhenius prefactors of 0.13 +/- 0.03 ({AH}/{AT}) and 0.52 +/- 0.05 ({AD}/{AT}). Both values are well below the lower limits predicted in the absence of tunneling contributions to the reaction coordinate, indicating that both deuterium and protium tunneling take place in this reaction. The presence of a temperature independent commitment contribution cannot be rigorously ruled out; however, the effect of such a commitment on the observed {AH}/{AT} and {AD}/{AT} values is shown to be quite small.},

	abstract = {Since hydride transfer is completely rate limiting for yeast formate dehydrogenase [Blanchard, J.S., \& Cleland, W. W. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 3543], the intrinsic isotope effects on this reaction are fully expressed. Primary deuterium, 13C, and 18O isotope effects in formate and the alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effect at C-4 of the nucleotide have been measured for nucleotide substrates with redox potentials varying from -0.320 ({NAD}) to -0.258 V (acetylpyridine-{NAD}). As the redox potential gets more positive, the primary deuterium isotope effect increases from 2.2 to 3.1, the primary 13C isotope effect decreases from 1.042 to 1.036, the alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effect drops from 1.23 to 1.06, and Vmax decreases. The 18O isotope effects increase from 1.005 to 1.008 per single 18O substitution in formate (these values are dominated by the normal isotope effect on the dehydration of formate during binding; pyridinealdehyde-{NAD} gives an inverse value, possibly because it is not fully dehydrated during binding). These isotope effects suggest a progression toward earlier transition states as the redox potential of the nucleotide becomes more positive, with {NAD} having a late and acetyl-pyridine-{NAD} a nearly symmetrical transition state. By contrast, the I2 oxidation of formate in dimethyl sulfoxide has a very early transition state (13k = 1.0154; Dk = 2.2; 18k = 0.9938), which becomes later as the proportion of water in the solvent increases (13k = 1.0265 in 40\% dimethyl sulfoxide and 1.0362 in water). alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effects with formate dehydrogenase are decreased halfway to the equilibrium isotope effect when deuterated formate is the substrate, showing that the bending motion of the secondary hydrogen is coupled to hydride transfer in the transition state and that tunneling of the two hydrogens is involved. The 15N isotope effect of 1.07 for {NAD} labeled at N-1 of the nicotinamide ring suggests that N-1 becomes pyramidal during the reaction. 18O fractionation factors for formate ion relative to aqueous solution are 1.0016 in sodium formate crystal, 1.0042 bound to Dowex-1, and 1.0040 as an ion pair (probably hydrated) in {CHCl}3. The {CO}2 analogue azide binds about 10(4) times better than the formate analogue nitrate to enzyme-nucleotide complexes (even though the Ki values for both and the affinity for formate vary by 2 orders of magnitude among the various nucleotides), but the ratio is not sensitive to the redox potential of the nucleotide. Thus, not the nature of the transition state but rather the shape of the initial binding pocket for formate is determining the relative affinity.},

Within this theory we derive a simple {KIE} expression for vibrationally enhanced ground state tunneling that is able to fit the data for the bovine serum amine oxidase ({BSAO}) system, correctly predicting the large temperature dependence of the {KIEs}. Because the {KIEs} in this theory can resemble those for nontunneling dynamics, distinguishing the two possibilities requires careful measurements over a range of temperatures, as has been done for {BSAO}.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen quantum mechanical tunneling has been suggested to play a role in a wide variety of hydrogen-transfer reactions in chemistry and enzymology. An important experimental criterion for tunneling is based on the breakdown of the semiclassical prediction for the relationship among the rates of the three isotopes of hydrogen (hydrogen -H, deuterium -D, and tritium -T). This is denoted the Swain-Schaad relationship. This study examines the breakdown of the Swain-Schaad relationship as criterion for tunneling. The semiclassical (no tunneling) limit used hereto (e.g., 3.34, for H/T to D/T kinetic isotope effects), was based on simple theoretical considerations of a diatomic cleavage of a stable covalent bond, for example, a C-H bond. Yet, most experimental evidence for a tunneling contribution has come from breakdown of those relationship for a secondary hydrogen, that is, not the hydrogen whose bond is being cleaved but its geminal neighbor. Furthermore, many of the reported experiments have been mixed-labeling experiments, in which a secondary H/T kinetic isotope effect was measured for C-H cleavage, while the D/T secondary effect accompanied C-D cleavage. In experiments of this type, the breakdown of the Swain-Schaad relationship indicates both tunneling and the degree of coupled motion between the primary and secondary hydrogens. We found a new semiclassical limit (e.g., 4.8 for H/T to D/T kinetic isotope effects), whose breakdown can serve as a more reliable experimental evidence for tunneling in this common mixed-labeling experiment. We study the tunneling contribution to C-H bond activation, for which many relevant experimental and theoretical data are available. However, these studies can be applied to any hydrogen-transfer reaction. First, an extension of the original approach was applied, and then vibrational analysis studies were carried out for a model system (the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase). Finally, the effect of complex kinetics on the observed Swain-Schaad relationship was examined. All three methods yield a new semiclassical limit (4.8), above which tunneling must be considered. Yet, it was found that for many cases the original, localized limit (3.34), holds fairly well. For experimental results that are between the original and new limits (within statistical errors), several methods are suggested that can support or exclude tunneling. These new and clearer criteria provide a basis for future applications of the Swain-Schaad relationship to demonstrate tunneling in complex systems.},

The central concept is "dynamical fingerprints" which contain peaks at the time scales of the dynamical processes involved with amplitudes determined by the experimental observable. Fingerprints can be generated from both experimental and simulation data, and their comparison by matching peaks permits assignment of structural changes present in the simulation to experimentally observed relaxation processes. The approach is applied here to a test case interpreting single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments on a set of fluorescent peptides with molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides exhibit complex kinetics shown to be consistent with the apparent simplicity of the experimental data. Moreover, the fingerprint approach can be used to design new experiments with site-specific labels that optimally probe specific dynamical processes in the molecule under investigation.},

	abstract = {The equilibrium kinetics of biomolecules can be probed by techniques such as temperature-jump or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. These measurements can be described by dynamical fingerprints, i.e., densities of relaxation timescales where each peak corresponds to an exponential relaxation process. In many cases, single- or double-peaked fingerprints are found, suggesting that a two- or three-state model may provide a satisfactory description of the biomolecule studied, while simulations often reveal a more complex picture with many kinetically relevant states. Here we sketch an approach combining Markov models of the simulated dynamics with dynamical fingerprints to link between simulation and experiment. This link sheds light on the relation between experimental setup and sensitivity of the experiment to particular kinetic processes. Furthermore, our approach can be used to design experiments such that specific processes appear with large amplitudes.This is illustrated by reviewing recent results from the analysis of the fluorescent 18-mer peptide {MR}121-({GS}) 9-W. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These results reveal no difference between the high frequency vibration mean-square displacement of the native and the immobilized E. coli {DHFR}. However, length-scale-dependent, picosecond dynamical changes are found. On longer length scales, the dynamics are comparable for both {DHFR} samples. On shorter length scales, the dynamics is dominated by local jump motions over potential barriers. The residence time for the protons to stay in a potential well is tau = 7.95 +/- 1.02 ps for the native {DHFR} and tau = 20.36 +/- 1.80 ps for the immobilized {DHFR}. The average height of the potential barrier to the local motions is increased in the immobilized {DHFR}, and may increase the activation energy for the activity reaction, decreasing the rate as observed experimentally. These results suggest that the local motions on the picosecond timescale may act as a lubricant for those associated with {DHFR} activity occurring on a slower millisecond timescale. Experiments indicate a significantly slower catalytic reaction rate for the immobilized E. coli {DHFR}. However, the immobilization of the {DHFR} is on the exterior of the enzyme and essentially distal to the active site, thus this phenomenon has broad implications for the action of drugs distal to the active site.},

	abstract = {Time-resolved fluorescence techniques were utilized to monitor the kinetic refolding reaction of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}). Measurements of emission and anisotropy decay lifetimes of both the five intrinsic tryptophan residues and the fluorescent probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate ({ANS}) during the folding reaction were used to characterize the compactness and development of tertiary structure in transient intermediates formed during the folding of {DHFR}. Experiments monitoring bound {ANS} show that a rapidly-formed intermediate ({\textbackslash}textless 20 ms) has a rotational time of approximately 10 ns and, therefore, a compactness similar to that for the native conformation. All of the tryptophan residues in this burst phase species rotate as freely as in the unfolded state. In the set of four intermediates which then appear over the next few hundred milliseconds, the apparent rotational time measured by {ANS} fluorescence increases to a maximum rotational time of approximately 20 ns. An increase in the average tryptophan lifetime for these intermediates suggests these side chains become excluded from solvent and associated dynamic quenching mechanisms. As the folding reaction proceeds to a set of four native conformers the bound {ANS} rotational time then decreases to approach that for the native protein, 10.5 ns, and the average tryptophan rotational time increases to the same value. During these rate-limiting, final steps in folding, the static quenching effects which reflect the formation of specific tertiary contacts involving tryptophans also appear.},

We show that common methods of data evaluation, such as the determination of peak heights and peak volumes, may be subject to bias, giving incorrect values for quantities such as R1 and R2. For example, one common method of peak-height determination, using a search routine to obtain the peak-height maximum in successive spectra, may be a source of significant systematic error in the relaxation rate. The alternative use of peak volumes or of a fixed coordinate position for the peak height in successive spectra gives more accurate results, particularly in cases where the signal/noise is low, but these methods have inherent problems of their own. For example, volumes are difficult to quantitate for overlapped peaks. We show that with any method of sampling the peak intensity, the choice of a 2- or 3-parameter equation to fit the exponential relaxation decay curves can dramatically affect both the accuracy and precision of the calculated relaxation rates. In general, a 2-parameter fit of relaxation decay curves is preferable. However, for very low intensity peaks a 3 parameter fit may be more appropriate.},

Oftentimes collective variables ({CVs}), derived through some chemical intuition about the process of interest, serve this purpose. Because finding these {CVs} is the most difficult part of any investigation, we recently developed a dimensionality reduction algorithm, sketch-map, that can be used to build a low-dimensional map of a phase space of high-dimensionality. In this paper we discuss how these machine-generated {CVs} can be used to accelerate the exploration of phase space and to reconstruct free-energy landscapes. To do so, we develop a formalism in which high-dimensional configurations are no longer represented by low-dimensional position vectors. Instead, for each configuration we calculate a probability distribution, which has a domain that encompasses the entirety of the low-dimensional space. To construct a biasing potential, we exploit an analogy with metadynamics and use the trajectory to adaptively construct a repulsive, history-dependent bias from the distributions that correspond to the previously visited configurations. This potential forces the system to explore more of phase space by making it desirable to adopt configurations whose distributions do not overlap with the bias. We apply this algorithm to a small model protein and succeed in reproducing the free-energy surface that we obtain from a parallel tempering calculation.},

	abstract = {Many interesting dynamic properties of biological molecules cannot be simulated directly using molecular dynamics because of nanosecond time scale limitations. These systems are trapped in potential energy minima with high free energy barriers for large numbers of computational steps. The dynamic evolution of many molecular systems occurs through a series of rare events as the system moves from one potential energy basin to another. Therefore, we have proposed a robust bias potential function that can be used in an efficient accelerated molecular dynamics approach to simulate the transition of high energy barriers without any advance knowledge of the location of either the potential energy wells or saddle points. In this method, the potential energy landscape is altered by adding a bias potential to the true potential such that the escape rates from potential wells are enhanced, which accelerates and extends the time scale in molecular dynamics simulations. Our definition of the bias potential echoes the underlying shape of the potential energy landscape on the modified surface, thus allowing for the potential energy minima to be well defined, and hence properly sampled during the simulation. We have shown that our approach, which can be extended to biomolecules, samples the conformational space more efficiently than normal molecular dynamics simulations, and converges to the correct canonical distribution.},

Using linear-scaling density functional theory and atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning, environment-specific charges and Lennard-Jones parameters are derived directly from quantum mechanical calculations for use in biomolecular modeling of organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed methods significantly reduce the number of empirical parameters needed to construct molecular mechanics force fields, naturally include polarization effects in charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and scale well to systems comprised of thousands of atoms, including proteins. The feasibility and benefits of this approach are demonstrated by computing free energies of hydration, properties of pure liquids, and the relative binding free energies of indole and benzofuran to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme.},

In addition to general interest in their biological roles, these proteins present a fundamental scientific puzzle, since the origin of their tremendous catalytic power is still unclear. While many different hypotheses have been put forward to rationalize this, one of the proposals that has become particularly popular in recent years is the idea that dynamical effects contribute to catalysis. Here, we present a critical review of the dynamical idea, considering all reasonable definitions of what does and does not qualify as a dynamical effect. We demonstrate that no dynamical effect (according to these definitions) has ever been experimentally shown to contribute to catalysis. Furthermore, the existence of non-negligible dynamical contributions to catalysis is not supported by consistent theoretical studies. Our review is aimed, in part, at readers with a background in chemical physics and biophysics, and illustrates that despite a substantial body of experimental effort, there has not yet been any study that consistently established a connection between an enzyme's conformational dynamics and a significant increase in the catalytic contribution of the chemical step. We also make the point that the dynamical proposal is not a semantic issue but a well-defined scientific hypothesis with well-defined conclusions.},

The rate of {TTQ} reduction by dopamine in {AADH} has a large, temperature independent kinetic isotope effect ({KIE} = 12.9 +/- 0.2), which is highly suggestive of vibrationally assisted tunneling. H-transfer is compromised with benzylamine as substrate and the {KIE} is deflated (4.8 +/- 0.2). The {KIE} is temperature-independent, but reaction rates are strongly dependent on temperature. With tryptamine as substrate reaction rates can be determined only at low temperature as C-H bond cleavage is rapid, and an exceptionally large {KIE} (54.7 +/- 1.0) is observed. Studies with deuterated tryptamine suggest vibrationally assisted tunneling is the mechanism of deuterium and, by inference, hydrogen transfer. Bond cleavage by {MADH} using a slow substrate (ethanolamine) occurs with an inflated {KIE} (14.7 +/- 0.2 at 25 degrees C). The {KIE} is temperature-dependent, consistent with differential tunneling of protium and deuterium. Our observations illustrate the different modes of H-transfer in {MADH} and {AADH} with fast and slow substrates and highlight the importance of barrier shape in determining reaction rate.},

The magnitude of this kinetic isotope effect appears to exceed the semiclassical limit for a proton abstraction. It is also nearly identical to values for the similar reactions catalyzed by methylamine dehydrogenase, which also possesses {TTQ}, and plasma amine oxidase, which possesses the topaquinone cofactor. These data suggest that these three quinoproteins share a very similar and possible unique mechanism for catalyzing the oxidative deamination of primary amines. ?? 1995.},

In light of this, it is imperative to have a quantitative model for examining chemical reactivity, both in the condensed phase and in solution, as well as to accurately quantify physical organic chemistry (particularly as experimental approaches can often be inconclusive). Similarly, computational approaches allow for great progress in studying enzyme catalysis, as they allow for the separation of the relevant energy contributions to catalysis. Due to the complexity of the problems that need addressing, there is a need for an approach that can combine reliability with an ability to capture complex systems in order to resolve long-standing controversies in a unique way. Herein, we will demonstrate that the empirical valence bond ({EVB}) approach provides a powerful way to connect the classical concepts of physical organic chemistry to the actual energies of enzymatic reactions by means of computation. Additionally, we will discuss the proliferation of this approach, as well as attempts to capture its basic chemistry and repackage it under different names. We believe that the {EVB} approach is the most powerful tool that is currently available for studies of chemical processes in the condensed phase in general and enzymes in particular, particularly when trying to explore the different proposals about the origin of the catalytic power of enzymes.

Early chapters introduce basic concepts and models, which underpin more detailed discussion of theory and experimental approaches, with reference to key case studies. This introduction to modern theories of enzyme catalysis presents the latest methods used to study quantum tunnelling in biological systems. Written in an accessible style, it is suitable for a wide audience but will be particularly useful to advanced level undergraduates, postgraduates and early postdoctoral researchers. The book starts with an introduction by Nobel Laureate, Rudolph A. Marcus. The reader is then guided through computational, kinetic and structural analysis of tunnelling and the synergy in combining these methods (with a major focus on H-tunneling reactions in enzyme systems).

	abstract = {The idea that enzyme catalysis involves special factors such as coherent fluctuations, quantum mechanical tunnelling and non-equilibrium solvation ({NES}) effects has gained popularity in recent years. It has also been suggested that transition state theory ({TST}) cannot be used in studies of enzyme catalysis. The present work uses reliable state of the art simulation approaches to examine the above ideas. We start by demonstrating that we are able to simulate any of the present catalytic proposals using the empirical valence bond ({EVB}) potential energy surfaces, the dispersed polaron model and the quantized classical path ({QCP}) approach, as well as the approximate vibronic method. These approaches do not treat the catalytic effects by phenomenological treatments and thus can be considered as first principles approaches (at least their ability to compare enzymatic reaction to the corresponding solution reactions). This work will consider the lipoxygenase reaction, and to lesser extent other enzymes, for specific demonstration. It will be pointed out that our study of the lipoxygenase reaction reproduces the very large observed isotope effect and the observed rate constant while obtaining no catalytic contribution from nuclear quantum mechanical ({NQM}) effects. Furthermore, it will be clarified that our studies established that the {NQM} effect decreases rather than increases when the donor-acceptor distance is compressed. The consequences of these findings in terms of the temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect and in terms of different catalytic proposals will be discussed. This paper will also consider briefly the dynamical effects and conclude that such effects do not contribute in a significant way to enzyme catalysis. Furthermore, it will be pointed out that, in contrast to recent suggestions, {NES} effects are not dynamical effects and should therefore be part of the activation free energy rather than the transmission factor. In view of findings of the present work and our earlier works, it seems that {TST} provides a quantitative tool for studies of enzyme catalysis and that the key open questions are related to the nature of the factors that lead to transition state stabilization.},

Its temperature optimum is 22-25 {degreesC} higher than that of the E. coli enzyme; however, it is hardly active at room temperature. The increased conformational rigidity required to stabilize the thermophilic enzyme against heat denaturation might explain its different temperature-activity profile. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies were performed on this thermophilic-mesophilic enzyme pair to compare their conformational flexibilities. It was found that Th. thermophilus {IPMDH} is significantly more rigid at room temperature than E. coli {IPMDH}, whereas the enzymes have nearly identical flexibilities under their respective optimal working conditions, suggesting that evolutionary adaptation tends to maintain a "corresponding state" regarding conformational flexibility. These observations confirm that conformational fluctuations necessary for catalytic function are restricted at room temperature in the thermophilic enzyme, suggesting a close relationship between conformational flexibility and enzyme function.},

On the basis of extensive computer simulations for wild-type {DHFR} from Escherichia coli and four mutants (G121S, G121V, M42F, and M42F/G121S), we show that key parameters for catalysis are changed. The parameters we study are relative populations of different conformations sampled and hydrogen bonds. We find that the mutations result in long-range structural perturbations, rationalizing the effects that the mutations have on the kinetics of the enzyme. Such perturbations also provide a rationalization for the reported nonadditivity effect for double mutations. We finally examine the role a structural perturbation will have on the hydride transfer step. On the basis of our new findings, we discuss the role of coupled motions between distant regions in the enzyme, which previously was reported by Radkiewicz and Brooks.},

The simulations indicate that the decrease in the hydride transfer rate for the G121V mutant is due to an increase in the free energy barrier. The calculated free energy barrier is higher for the mutant than for the wild-type enzyme by an amount that is consistent with the experimentally observed rate reduction.

	abstract = {Proton tunneling dominates the oxidative deamination of tryptamine catalyzed by the enzyme aromatic amine dehydrogenase. For reaction with the fast substrate tryptamine, a H/D kinetic isotope effect ({KIE}) of 55 +/- 6 has been reported-one of the largest observed in an enzyme reaction. We present here a computational analysis of this proton-transfer reaction, applying combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ({QM}/{MM}) methods ({PM}3-{SRP}//{PM}3/{CHARMM}22). In particular, we extend our previous computational study (Masgrau et al. Science 2006, 312, 237) by using improved energy corrections, high-level {QM}/{MM} methods, and an ensemble of paths to estimate the tunneling contributions. We have carried out {QM}/{MM} molecular dynamics simulations and variational transition state theory calculations with small-curvature tunneling corrections. The results provide detailed insight into the processes involved in the reaction. Transfer to the O2 oxygen of the catalytic base, Asp128beta, is found to be the favored reaction both thermodynamically and kinetically, even though O1 is closer in the reactant complex. Comparison of quantum and classical models of proton transfer allows estimation of the contribution of hydrogen tunneling in lowering the barrier to reaction in the enzyme. A reduction of the activation free energy due to tunneling of 3.1 kcal mol-1 is found, which represents a rate enhancement due to tunneling by 2 orders of magnitude. The calculated {KIE} of 30 is significantly elevated over the semiclassical limit, in agreement with the experimental observations; a semiclassical value of 6 is obtained when tunneling is omitted. A polarization of the C-H bond to be broken is observed due to the close proximity of the catalytic aspartate and the (formally) positively charged imine nitrogen. A comparison is also made with the related quinoprotein methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH})-the much lower {KIE} of 11 that we obtain for the {MADH}/methylamine system is found to arise from a more endothermic potential energy surface for the {MADH} reaction.},

Its ability to catalyze the oxidative deamination of a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic amines has been investigated. Steady-state and transient kinetic studies of the reaction of {AADH} with a series of p-substituted phenylethylamines were performed to determine structure-reactivity correlations. The Km values correlated strongly with hydrophobic effects. The microscopic rate constant associated with {TTQ} reduction, k3, correlated with electronic substituent effects, particularly field/inductive effects, in a manner consistent with the formation of a carbanionic reaction intermediate in the reductive half-reaction. Transient kinetic studies were also performed with a series of p-substituted benzylamines, which were not substrates in the steady-state assay, but which did stoichiometrically reduce {TTQ}. The k3 for the reaction with benzylamines also correlated well with electronic effects. The rate constant associated with the release of the aldehyde product was also determined for the phenylethylamines and appears to be the most rate-limiting step in the overall oxidation-reduction reaction. This rate constant correlated with hydrophobic amines. This substrate specificity for aliphatic amines is opposite of that of methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}), the other known {TTQ} enzyme. On the basis of these studies, a reaction mechanism is proposed for {AADH}. These data are discussed in relation to the results of structure-reactivity correlation studies of the reactions catalyzed by {MADH} and two eukaryotic quinoproteins with different quinone prosthetic groups, plasma amine oxidase and lysyl oxidase.},

Neither subunit cross-reacted immunologically with antibodies to the corresponding subunits of {MADH}, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the beta subunit of {AADH} exhibited no homology with the highly conserved beta subunits of {MADH}. The absorption spectra for the oxidized, semiquinone, and reduced forms of {AADH} have been characterized, and extinction coefficients for the absorption maxima of each redox form have been determined. These spectra are very similar to those for {MADH}, indicating the likelihood of a {TTQ} cofactor. This was verified by the near identity of the vibrational frequencies and intensities in the resonance Raman spectra for the oxidized forms of {AADH} and {MADH}. A stable semiquinone of {AADH} could be observed during a reductive titration with dithionite, whereas titration with tyramine proceeded directly from the oxidized to the reduced form. {AADH} was very stable against denaturation by heat and exposure to guanidine. The individual subunits could be separated by gel filtration after incubation in guanidine hydrochloride, and partial reconstitution of activity was observed on recombination of the subunits. Steady-state kinetic analysis of {AADH} yielded a Vmax of 17 mumol/min/mg and a Km for tyramine of 5.4 {microM}. Substrate inhibition by tyramine was observed. {AADH} was irreversibly inhibited by hydrazine, phenylhydrazine, hydroxylamine, semicarbazide, and aminoguanidine. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid) and isonicotinic acid 2-isopropyl hydrazide (iproniazid) were reversible noncompetitive inhibitors of {AADH} and exhibited K(i) values of 8 and 186 {microM}, respectively.

Here, we characterize {ECD} in Cyclophilin A, a well-studied peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, using normal and accelerated, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Kinetics and free energy landscape of the isomerization reaction in solution and enzyme are explored in unconstrained simulations by allowing significantly lower torsional barriers, but in no way compromising the atomistic description of the system or the explicit solvent. We reveal that the reaction dynamics is intricately coupled to enzymatic motions that span multiple timescales and the enzyme modes are selected based on the energy barrier of the chemical step. We show that Kramers' rate theory can be used to present a clear rationale of how {ECD} affects the reaction dynamics and catalytic rates. The effects of {ECD} can be incorporated into the effective diffusion coefficient, which we estimate to be about ten times slower in enzyme than in solution. {ECD} thereby alters the preexponential factor, effectively impeding the rate enhancement. From our analyses, the trend observed for lower torsional barriers can be extrapolated to actual isomerization barriers, allowing successful prediction of the speedup in rates in the presence of {CypA}, which is in notable agreement with experimental estimates. Our results further reaffirm transition state stabilization as the main effect in enhancing chemical rates and provide a unified view of {ECD}'s role in catalysis from an atomistic perspective.},

While important insights can in principle be gained by accurate and well-established methods like ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the computational costs of these techniques are often very high. This prevents studying large systems on long time scales, which is severely limiting the applicability of computer simulations to address a wide range of interesting phenomena. Developing more efficient potentials enabling the simulation of water including dissociation and recombination events with first-principles accuracy is a very challenging task. In particular protonated water clusters have become important model systems to assess the reliability of such potentials, as the presence of the excess proton induces substantial changes in the local hydrogen bond patterns and many energetically similar isomers exist, which are extremely difficult to describe. In recent years it has been demonstrated for a number of systems including neutral water clusters of varying size that neural networks ({NNs}) can be used to construct potentials with close to first-principles accuracy. Based on density-functional theory ({DFT}) calculations, here we present a reactive full-dimensional {NN} potential for protonated water clusters up to the octamer. A detailed investigation of this potential shows that the energetic, structural, and vibrational properties are in excellent agreement with {DFT} results making the {NN} approach a very promising candidate for developing a high-quality potential for water. This finding is further supported by first preliminary but very encouraging {NN}-based simulations of the bulk liquid.},

In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics ({REMD}) method and its application to protein folding are described.

A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures. The simulation results show that the combined trajectories in temperature and configurational space allow a replica to overcome free energy barriers present at low temperatures. These large-scale simulations also reveal detailed results on folding mechanisms, intermediate state structures, thermodynamic properties, and the temperature dependences for both protein systems.},

In a previous paper, we described an efficient method for calculating the uncertainty due to finite sampling in the mean first passage time between two states. In this paper, we extend the uncertainty analysis to derive similar closed-form solutions for the distributions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix, quantities that have numerous applications when using the model. We demonstrate the accuracy of the distributions on a six-state model of the terminally blocked alanine peptide. We also show how to significantly reduce the total number of simulations necessary to build a model with a given precision using these uncertainty estimates for the blocked alanine system and for a 2454-state {MSM} for the dynamics of the villin headpiece.},

Their influence on reaction chemistry has been inferred indirectly from studies of the anomalous temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects and computational simulations. But can such motion reduce the width and height of energy barriers along the reaction coordinate, and contribute to quantum mechanical and/or classical nuclear-transfer chemistry? Here we discuss contemporary ideas for enzymatic reactions invoking a role for fast 'promoting' (or 'compressive') motions that, in principle, can aid hydrogen-transfer reactions. Of key importance is the direct demonstration of a role for compressive motions and the ability to understand in atomic detail the structural origin of these fast motions, but so far this has not been achieved. Here we discuss both indirect experimental evidence that supports a role for compressive motion and the additional insight gained from computational simulations.},

To meet this challenge, we explore the possibility of constructing accurate stochastic models of the spin label dynamics from atomistic trajectories. A systematic, two-step procedure, based on the probabilistic framework of hidden Markov models, is developed to build a discrete-time Markov chain process that faithfully captures the internal spin label dynamics on time scales longer than about 150 ps. The constructed Markov model is used both to gain insight into the long-lived conformations of the spin label and to generate the stochastic trajectories required for the simulation of {ESR} spectra. The methodology is illustrated with an application to the case of a spin-labeled poly alanine alpha helix in explicit solvent.},

The investigation of the molecular and atomic group scaling schemes against static and dynamic properties of a test system (a solvated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor) has confirmed their equivalence also for large molecules such as proteins. For the specific test system the simulation box cell volume upon changes of pressure decays to its equilibrium value within 5 ps of simulation for both approaches.

	abstract = {The structural origin of enzyme adaptation to low temperature, allowing efficient catalysis of chemical reactions even near the freezing point of water, remains a fundamental puzzle in biocatalysis. A remarkable universal fingerprint shared by all cold-active enzymes is a reduction of the activation enthalpy accompanied by a more negative entropy, which alleviates the exponential decrease in chemical reaction rates caused by lowering of the temperature. Herein, we explore the role of protein surface mobility in determining this enthalpy–entropy balance. The effects of modifying surface rigidity in cold-and warm-active trypsins are demonstrated here by calculation of high-precision Arrhenius plots and thermodynamic activation parameters for the peptide hydrolysis reaction, using extensive computer simulations. The protein surface flexibility is systematically varied by applying positional restraints, causing the remarkable effect of turning the cold-active trypsin into a variant with mesophilic characteristics without changing the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, we show that just restraining a key surface loop causes the same effect as a point mu-tation in that loop between the cold-and warm-active trypsin. Importantly, changes in the activation enthalpy–entropy balance of up to 10 kcal/mol are almost perfectly balanced at room tem-perature, whereas they yield significantly higher rates at low tem-peratures for the cold-adapted enzyme. enzyme cold adaptation {\textbar} thermodynamic activation parameters {\textbar} empirical valence bond {\textbar} temperature dependence {\textbar} molecular dynamics C old-adapted enzymes are able to catalyze their reactions with chemical rates comparable to and often exceeding those of their warm-active counterparts, and they are a remarkable ex-ample of how evolution can tune the biophysical properties of en-zymes.

As such, a better understanding of this thermodynamic parameter and its structural origin will provide new insights for the development of better molecular design strategies. In this paper we have analyzed the absolute heat capacity of proteins in different conformations. The results of these studies indicate that three major terms account for the absolute heat capacity of a protein: (1) one term that depends only on the primary or covalent structure of a protein and contains contributions from vibrational frequencies arising from the stretching and bending modes of each valence bond and internal rotations; (2) a term that contains the contributions of noncovalent interactions arising from secondary and tertiary structure; and (3) a term that contains the contributions of hydration. For a typical globular protein in solution the bulk of the heat capacity at 25 degrees C is given by the covalent structure term (close to 85\% of the total). The hydration term contributes about 15 and 40\% to the total heat capacity of the native and unfolded states, respectively. The contribution of non-covalent structure to the total heat capacity of the native state is positive but very small and does not amount to more than 3\% at 25 degrees C. The change in heat capacity upon unfolding is primarily given by the increase in the hydration term (about 95\%) and to a much lesser extent by the loss of noncovalent interactions (up to approximately 5\%).},

	abstract = {Markov state models ({MSMs}) are an extremely useful tool for understanding the conformational dynamics of macromolecules and for analyzing {MD} simulations in a quantitative fashion. They have been extensively used for peptide and protein folding, for small molecule binding, and for the study of native ensemble dynamics. Here, we adapt the {MSM} methodology to gain insight into the dynamics of misfolded states. To overcome possible flaws in root-mean-square deviation ({RMSD})-based metrics, we introduce a novel discretization approach, based on coarse-grained contact maps. In addition, we extend the {MSM} methodology to include “sink” states in order to account for the irreversibility (on simulation time scales) of processes like protein misfolding. We apply this method to analyze the mechanism of misfolding of tandem repeats of titin domains, and how it is influenced by confinement in a chaperonin-like cavity.},

The chemoselectivity of alkene oxidation is an important problem to address, as it can result in the formation of epoxides, which can have toxic effects. In this paper the epoxidation and hydroxylation of cyclohexene and propene by the bacterial P450(cam) isoform are modeled with hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical ({QM}/{MM}) methods. Snapshots for {QM}/{MM} modeling are chosen from molecular dynamics trajectories, to sample the different conformations of the enzyme-substrate complex. The energy barriers obtained for these processes are in qualitative agreement with experimental work, supporting the use of {QM}/{MM} methods in the study of selectivity for this class of enzyme. This work highlights the complexity involved in modeling these systems with {QM}/{MM} and the importance in the selection of starting geometries.},

	doi = {10.1039/b313759g},
	abstract = {To investigate fundamental features of enzyme catalysis, there is a need for high-level calculations capable of modelling crucial, unstable species such as transition states as they are formed within enzymes. We have modelled an important model enzyme reaction, the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate in chorismate mutase, by combined ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ({QM}/{MM}) methods. The best estimates of the potential energy barrier in the enzyme are 7.4-11.0 kcal mol(-1)({MP}2/6-31+G(d)//6-31G(d)/{CHARMM}22) and 12.7-16.1 kcal mol(-1)(B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)//6-31G(d)/{CHARMM}22), comparable to the experimental estimate of Delta H(++)= 12.7 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1). The results provide unequivocal evidence of transition state ({TS}) stabilization by the enzyme, with contributions from residues Arg90, Arg7, and Arg63. Glu78 stabilizes the prephenate product (relative to substrate), and can also stabilize the {TS}. Examination of the same pathway in solution (with a variety of continuum models), at the same ab initio levels, allows comparison of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions. Calculated barriers in solution are 28.0 kcal mol(-1)({MP}2/6-31+G(d)/{PCM}) and 24.6 kcal mol(-1)(B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)/{PCM}), comparable to the experimental finding of Delta G(++)= 25.4 kcal mol(-1) and consistent with the experimentally-deduced 10(6)-fold rate acceleration by the enzyme. The substrate is found to be significantly distorted in the enzyme, adopting a structure closer to the transition state, although the degree of compression is less than predicted by lower-level calculations. This apparent substrate strain, or compression, is potentially also catalytically relevant. Solution calculations, however, suggest that the catalytic contribution of this compression may be relatively small. Consideration of the same reaction pathway in solution and in the enzyme, involving reaction from a 'near-attack conformer' of the substrate, indicates that adoption of this conformation is not in itself a major contribution to catalysis. Transition state stabilization (by electrostatic interactions, including hydrogen bonds) is found to be central to catalysis by the enzyme. Several hydrogen bonds are observed to shorten at the {TS}. The active site is clearly complementary to the transition state for the reaction, stabilizing it more than the substrate, so reducing the barrier to reaction.},

We introduce a definition of the natural reaction coordinate, suitable for condensed phase and biomolecular systems, as a maximally predictive one-dimensional projection. We then show this criterion is uniquely satisfied by a dominant eigenfunction of an integral operator associated with the ensemble dynamics. We present a new sparse estimator for these eigenfunctions which can search through a large candidate pool of structural order parameters and build simple, interpretable approximations that employ only a small number of these order parameters. Example applications with a small molecule's rotational dynamics and simulations of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor show that this approach can filter through statistical noise to identify simple reaction coordinates from complex dynamics.},

	abstract = {Sodium hydroxide, {NaOH}, is one of the most widely-used chemical reagents, but the structural properties of its aqueous solutions have only sparingly been characterized. Here, we automatically classify the cation coordination polyhedra obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. We find that, for example, with increasing concentration, octahedral coordination geometries become less favored, while the opposite is true for the trigonal prism. At high concentrations, the coordination polyhedra frequently deviate considerably from ”ideal” polyhedra, because of an increased extent of interligand hydrogen-bonding, in which hydrogen bonds between two ligands, either {OH} 2 or {OH} À , around the same Na + are formed. In saturated solutions, with concentrations of about 19 mol L À1 , ligands are frequently shared between multiple Na + ions as a result of the deficiency of solvent molecules. This results in more complex structural patterns involving certain ”characteristic” polyhedron connectivities, such as octahedra sharing ligands with capped trigonal prisms, and tetrahedra sharing ligands with trigonal bipyramids. The simulations were performed using a density-functional-theory-based reactive high-dimensional neural network potential, that was extensively validated against available neutron and X-ray diffraction data from the literature.},

Because the quality of a {GB} model is heavily affected by empirical parameters used in calculating solvation energy, in this work we have refit these parameters for {GB}-Neck, a recently developed {GB} model, in order to improve the accuracy of both the solvation energy and effective radii calculations. The data sets used for fitting are significantly larger than those used in the past. Comparing to other pairwise {GB} models like {GB}-{OBC} and the original {GB}-Neck, the new {GB} model ({GB}-Neck2) has better agreement to Poisson-Boltzmann ({PB}) in terms of reproducing solvation energies for a variety of systems ranging from peptides to proteins. Secondary structure preferences are also in much better agreement with those obtained from explicit solvent {MD} simulations. We also obtain near-quantitative reproduction of experimental structure and thermal stability profiles for several model peptides with varying secondary structure motifs. Extension to non-protein systems will be explored in the future.},

In this paper we outline a number of established machine learning techniques and investigate the influence of the molecular representation on the methods performance.

	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimiza-tion. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a compar-ison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural net-works and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising con-figuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent " High Throughput " methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural base-line against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	doi = {10.1021/ct5010406},
	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the method of hydrogen mass repartitioning ({HMR}) is a potentially useful tool for accelerating molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. By repartitioning the mass of heavy atoms into the bonded hydrogen atoms, it is possible to slow the highest-frequency motions of the macromolecule under study, thus allowing the time step of the simulation to be increased by up to a factor of 2. In this communication, we investigate further how this mass repartitioning allows the simulation time step to be increased in a stable fashion without significantly increasing discretization error. To this end, we ran a set of simulations with different time steps and mass distributions on a three-residue peptide to get a comprehensive view of the effect of mass repartitioning and time step increase on a system whose accessible phase space is fully explored in a relatively short amount of time. We next studied a 129-residue protein, hen egg white lysozyme ({HEWL}), to verify that the observed behavior extends to a larger, more-realistic, system. Results for the protein include structural comparisons from {MD} trajectories, as well as comparisons of {pKa} calculations via constant-{pH} {MD}. We also calculated a potential of mean force ({PMF}) of a dihedral rotation for the {MTS} [(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate] spin label via umbrella sampling with a set of regular {MD} trajectories, as well as a set of mass-repartitioned trajectories with a time step of 4 fs. Since no significant difference in kinetics or thermodynamics is observed by the use of fast {HMR} trajectories, further evidence is provided that long-time-step {HMR} {MD} simulations are a viable tool for accelerating {MD} simulations for molecules of biochemical interest.},

However, historical associations of longevity with paternal ancestors' food supply in the slow growth period ({SGP}) in mid childhood have been reported. Using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ({ALSPAC}), we identified 166 fathers who reported starting smoking before age 11 years and compared the growth of their offspring with those with a later paternal onset of smoking, after correcting for confounders. We analysed food supply effects on offspring and grandchild mortality risk ratios ({RR}) using 303 probands and their 1818 parents and grandparents from the 1890, 1905 and 1920 verkalix cohorts, northern Sweden. After appropriate adjustment, early paternal smoking is associated with greater body mass index ({BMI}) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters. Sex-specific effects were also shown in the verkalix data; paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality {RR} of grandsons, while paternal grandmother's food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality {RR}. These transgenerational effects were observed with exposure during the {SGP} (both grandparents) or fetal/infant life (grandmothers) but not during either grandparent's puberty. We conclude that sex-specific, male-line transgenerational responses exist in humans and hypothesise that these transmissions are mediated by the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Such responses add an entirely new dimension to the study of gene–environment interactions in development and health.},

Postnatal depression in mothers affects the quality of maternal care, and can lead to disturbances in their children's social, behavioural, cognitive, and physical development. However, the effect of depression in fathers during the early years of a child's life has received little attention. Methods: As part of a large, population-based study of childhood, we assessed the presence of depressive symptoms in mothers (n=13 351) and fathers (n=12 884) 8 weeks after the birth of their child with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale ({EPDS}). Fathers were reassessed at 21 months. We identified any subsequent development of behavioural and emotional problems in their children (n=10 024) at age 3.5 years with maternal reports on the Rutter revised preschool scales. Findings: Information was available for 8431 fathers, 11.833 mothers, and 10 024 children. Depression in fathers during the postnatal period was associated with adverse emotional and behavioural outcomes in children aged 3.5 years (adjusted odds ratio 2.09, 95\% {CI} 1.42-3.08), and an increased risk of conduct problems in boys (2.66, 1.67-4.25). These effects remained even after controlling for maternal postnatal depression and later paternal depression. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that paternal depression has a specific and persisting detrimental effect on their children's early behavioural and emotional development.},

In recent years, the amount of available data has increased exponentially and " Big Data Analysis " is expected to be at the core of most future innovations. Due to the rapid development in the field of data analysis, there is still a lack of consensus on how one should approach predictive modelling problems in general. Another innovation in the field of predictive modelling is the use of data analysis competitions for model selection. This competitive approach is interesting and seems fruitful, but one could ask if the framework provided by for example Kaggle gives a trustworthy resemblance of real-world predictive modelling problems.},

This Review presents the general methodological aspects of the {QM}/{MM} approach, its use within optimization and simulation techniques, and its areas of application, always with a biomolecular focus. Combined quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics ({QM}/{MM}) approaches have become the method of choice for modeling reactions in biomolecular systems. Quantum-mechanical ({QM}) methods are required for describing chemical reactions and other electronic processes, such as charge transfer or electronic excitation. However, {QM} methods are restricted to systems of up to a few hundred atoms. However, the size and conformational complexity of biopolymers calls for methods capable of treating up to several 100 000 atoms and allowing for simulations over time scales of tens of nanoseconds. This is achieved by highly efficient, force-field-based molecular mechanics ({MM}) methods. Thus to model large biomolecules the logical approach is to combine the two techniques and to use a {QM} method for the chemically active region (e.g., substrates and co-factors in an enzymatic reaction) and an {MM} treatment for the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes are commonly referred to as combined or hybrid {QM}/{MM} methods. They enable the modeling of reactive biomolecular systems at a reasonable computational effort while providing the necessary accuracy.},

The mathematical theory of statistical inference was mainly developed by Ronald A. Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, and Egon S. Pearson. Fisher on the one side and Neyman–Pearson on the other were involved often in a polemic controversy. The common view is that Neyman and Pearson made Fisher's account more stringent mathematically. It is argued, however, that there is a profound theoretical basis for the controversy: both sides held conflicting views about the role of mathematical modelling. At the end, the influential programme of Exploratory Data Analysis is considered to be advocating another, more instrumental conception of models.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in the analysis of protein folding and other complex reactions is the determination of the reaction free energy landscape. The current experimental techniques lack the necessary spatial and temporal resolution to construct such landscapes. The properties of the landscapes can be probed only indirectly. Simulation, assuming that it reproduces the experimental dynamics, can provide the necessary spatial and temporal resolution. It is, arguably, the only way for direct rigorous construction of the quantitatively accurate free energy landscapes. Here, such landscape is constructed from the equilibrium folding simulation of {FIP}35 protein reported by Shaw et al. Science 2010, 330, 341-346. For the dynamics to be accurately described as diffusion on the free energy landscape, the choice of reaction coordinates is crucial. The reaction coordinate used here is such that the dynamics projected on it is diffusive, so the description is consistent and accurate. The obtained landscape suggests an alternative interpretation of the simulation, markedly different from that of Shaw et al. In particular, {FIP}35 is not an incipient downhill folder, it folds via a populated on-pathway intermediate separated by high free energy barriers; the high free energy barriers rather than landscape roughness are a major determinant of the rates for conformational transitions; the preexponential factor of folding kinetics 1/k(0) ∼ 10 ns rather than 1 μs.},

When these flexible regions are unresolvable structurally, computational reconstruction in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations can be used to guide the engineering strategy. Here we present a collaborative approach that consists of both experiment and computation and led to the discovery of a single mutation in the F/G loop of the nitrating cytochrome P450 {TxtE} that simultaneously controls loop dynamics and completely shifts the enzyme's regioselectivity from the C4 to the C5 position of L-tryptophan. Furthermore, we find that this loop mutation is naturally present in a subset of homologous nitrating P450s and confirm that these uncharacterized enzymes exclusively produce 5-nitro-L-tryptophan, a previously unknown biosynthetic intermediate.},

We report a synthetic receptor mimic that transmits structural information from a boron-based ligand binding site to a spectroscopic reporter located more than 2 nm away. Reversible binding of a diol ligand to the N-terminal binding site induces a screw-sense preference in a helical oligo(aminoisobutyric acid) foldamer, which is relayed to a reporter group at the remote C-terminus, communicating information about the structure and stereochemistry of the ligand. The reversible nature of boronate esterification was exploited to switch the receptor sequentially between left- and right-handed helices, while the exquisite conformational sensitivity of the helical relay allowed the reporter to differentiate even between purine and pyrimidine nucleosides as ligands.},

An hsp-4::gfp transcriptional reporter had relatively low basal green ¯uorescent protein ({GFP}) expression (most prominent in the spermatheca, Fig. 1a), but expression was strongly induced in the gut and hypodermis after treatment with {tunicamycinÐa} drug that induces {ER} stress (Fig. 1b). Inactivation of ire-1 function by {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) blocked both basal and inducible hsp-4::gfp expression (Fig. 1c), suggesting that ire-1 signalling is required for hsp-4 induction in C. elegans, as it is in yeast. To identify the genes required for the {UPR}, we sought mutations that blocked induction of the hsp-4::gfp reporter. Because treatment with tunicamycin occasionally produced variable and incomplete hsp-4::gfp induction, we ®rst isolated several mutations that constitutively activated hsp-4::gfp expression, presumably by causing {ER} stress. One semi-dominant mutation, upr-1(zc6)X, uniformly activated hsp-4::gfp in the posterior gut (Fig. 1d). We con®rmed that ire-1 {RNAi} suppressed hsp-4::gfp activation by upr-1 (zc6)X mutants (data not shown), and then we screened for mutations that blocked this activation. We found four ise-1 mutations that impaired hsp-4::gfp induction (Fig. 1e, f, j): zc10 and zc11 alter the 39 splice acceptor site of intron 2, and zc13 and zc14 are missense mutations that affect conserved residues in the kinase domain (G702D and G739R, respectively). A ®fth mutation, zc12, that strongly blocked hsp-4::gfp gene induction (Fig. 1g, h, j) mapped to the interval between cosmid F34D10 and dpy-17 on chromosome {III}. A plausible candidate for a downstream target of ire-1Ða predicted basic leucine zipper ({bZIP}) transcrip-tion factor gene, R74.3Ðwas located in this interval. Sequence analysis of zc12 mutants revealed a single nonsense mutation at residue 11 in the predicted R74.3 protein, and {RNAi} of R74.3 inhibited hsp-4::gfp induction (Fig. 1i). Together, these results indicate that R74.3 has an essential role in C. elegans {UPR}. The predicted R74.3 protein of C. elegans is most similar to mouse {XBP}-1 (X-box binding protein-1), which binds the {BiP} {ER} a Time (h) – 1 2 3 4 5 6 M r},

Here we show that {ecDNA} was found in nearly half of human cancers; its frequency varied by tumour type, but it was almost never found in normal cells. Driver oncogenes were amplified most commonly in {ecDNA}, thereby increasing transcript level. Mathematical modelling predicted that {ecDNA} amplification would increase oncogene copy number and intratumoural heterogeneity more effectively than chromosomal amplification. We validated these predictions by quantitative analyses of cancer samples. The results presented here suggest that {ecDNA} contributes to accelerated evolution in cancer.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the equilibrium ensemble of folding pathways, including their relative probability, is one of the major challenges in protein folding theory today. Although this information is in principle accessible via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, it is difficult to compute in practice because protein folding is a rare event and the affordable simulation length is typically not sufficient to observe an appreciable number of folding events, unless very simplified protein models are used. Here we present an approach that allows for the reconstruction of the full ensemble of folding pathways from simulations that are much shorter than the folding time. This approach can be applied to all-atom protein simulations in explicit solvent. It does not use a predefined reaction coordinate but is based on partitioning the state space into small conformational states and constructing a Markov model between them. A theory is presented that allows for the extraction of the full ensemble of transition pathways from the unfolded to the folded configurations. The approach is applied to the folding of a {PinWW} domain in explicit solvent where the folding time is two orders of magnitude larger than the length of individual simulations. The results are in good agreement with kinetic experimental data and give detailed insights about the nature of the folding process which is shown to be surprisingly complex and parallel. The analysis reveals the existence of misfolded trap states outside the network of efficient folding intermediates that significantly reduce the folding speed.},

	abstract = {Higher criticism, or second-level significance testing, is a multiple-comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey. It concerns a situation where there are many independent tests of significance and one is interested in rejecting the joint null hypothesis. Tukey suggested comparing the fraction of observed significances at a given \${\textbackslash}backslash\$alpha-level to the expected fraction under the joint null. In fact, he suggested standardizing the difference of the two quantities and forming a z-score; the resulting z-score tests the significance of the body of significance tests. We consider a generalization, where we maximize this z-score over a range of significance levels 0{\textbackslash}textless\${\textbackslash}backslash\$alpha\${\textbackslash}backslash\$leq\${\textbackslash}backslash\$alpha\_0. We are able to show that the resulting higher criticism statistic is effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero. The subtlety of this “sparse normal means” testing problem can be seen from work of Ingster and Jin, who studied such problems in great detail. In their studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little noticeable effect on the distribution of the p-values either for the bulk of the tests or for the few most highly significant tests. In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely specified alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses.},

The ensemble of configurations explored is analyzed using the recently proposed sketch-map algorithm. Further simulations allow us to probe how mutations affect the structures adopted by this protein. We find that many of the configurations adopted by a mutant are the same as those adopted by the wild-type protein. Furthermore, certain mutations destabilize secondary-structure-containing configurations by preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds or by promoting the formation of new intramolecular contacts. Our analysis demonstrates that machine-learning techniques can be used to study the energy landscapes of complex molecules and that the visualizations that are generated in this way provide a natural basis for examining how the stabilities of particular configurations of the molecule are affected by factors such as temperature or structural mutations.},

The {MSM} requires the construction of a discrete state-space such that two points are in the same state if they can interconvert rapidly. In the following, we suggest an improved method, which utilizes second order Independent Components Analysis (also known as time-structure based Independent Components Analysis, or {tICA}), to construct the state-space. We apply this method to simulations of {NTL}9 (provided by Lindorff-Larsen et al.

Additionally, the resulting model provides insight into the role of non-native contacts by revealing many slow timescales associated with compact, non-native states.},

A computer program was written to provide 4 computer algorithms and 4 combinations of cephalogram projections generating 22 linear and 10 angular 3-dimensional measurements from 20 landmarks. A new technique to produce biplanar cephalograms from a single x-ray source using a special facebow was developed, and its reliability was assessed. Sets of lateral, frontal, and basilar cephalograms of a human dried skull were taken both with 20 radiopaque landmark markers and without markers. Paired t tests based on marker position demonstrated reliability of the facebow; there were no statistically significant differences in repositioning the skull over time using the facebow at P {\textbackslash}textless.05. In the ideal situation, with minimal head rotation and landmark identification error (with the facebow and radiopaque markers), the average error of linear measurements was 1. 5 mm and 3.5(o) for the angular measurements. Subsequent trials evaluated the errors in head position (within 5(o) of head rotation) and in landmark identification (by removing all markers); two-way {ANOVA} with Scheffé groupings concluded that the vector intercept with manual adjustment algorithm using the lateral-frontal biplanar projection provides not only greater accuracy but also clinical practicality for both linear (mean of 2.2 mm error) and angular (mean of 4.0(o) error) measurements compared with direct or {CT} measurements (P {\textbackslash}textless.05). The effect of landmark identification error was found to be slightly greater than the head rotation error in the accuracy of 3-dimensional linear and angular measurements (mean, 2.85 mm error for linear and 4.4(o) error for angular measurements). Lastly, this study concluded that linear measurements in the transverse direction were found to have a slightly larger error than vertical measurements.

Methodology: This Cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in Swat and Shangla districts, {KPK}, from January to July 2014. It was a door to door survey of 800 families selected by random sampling from four different localities of these two districts. Information gathered included educational status of both parents, number of children less than 5 years, polio vaccination history (both routine immunization and house to house approach) complete polio vaccination history, polio awareness level of parents and reasons of refusals to polio vaccination. Data collected was analyzed with {SPSS} version 21. Chi-square test was used to ascertain the association between various categorical variables and p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: There were total 1775 children in age group 0-5 years in the 800 households under study. The children, who got vaccinated against polio, were 1392 (78\%). Out of rest, 294 (16.5\%) had not been vaccinated against polio and the parents of remaining 89 (5\%) children did not remember whether vaccination against polio was done or not. There was a significant association between educational status (minimum matriculate) of parents and polio vaccination (p=0.000). Conclusion: The present day situation of polio vaccination is encouraging in areas under research. Law and order situation, illiteracy and misperceptions about the vaccine should be addressed along with the capacity building of the health care staff as soon as possible through sincere coordinated efforts for complete eradication of polio by all concerned institutions.},

In the Bayesian framework the covariance structure can be specified using unknown hyperparameters. Integrating over these hyperparameters considers different possible explanations for the data when making predictions. This integration is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) sampling. However, with non-Gaussian observations standard hyperparameter sampling approaches require careful tuning and may converge slowly. In this paper we present a slice sampling approach that requires little tuning while mixing well in both strong- and weak-data regimes.},

	abstract = {This essay grew out of an examination of one-tailed significance testing. One-tailed tests were little advocated by the founders of modern statistics but are widely used and recommended nowadays in the biological, behavioral and social sciences. The high frequency of their use in ecology and animal behavior and their logical indefensibility have been documented in a companion review paper. In the present one, we trace the roots of this problem and counter some attacks on significance testing in general. Roots include: the early but irrational dichotomization of the P scale and adoption of the `significant/non-significant' terminology; the mistaken notion that a high P value is evidence favoring the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis; and confusion over the distinction between statistical and research hypotheses. Resultant widespread misuse and misinterpretation of significance tests have also led to other problems, such as unjustifiable demands that reporting of P values be disallowed or greatly reduced and that reporting of confidence intervals and standardized effect sizes be required in their place. Our analysis of these matters thus leads us to a recommendation that for standard types of significance assessment the {paleoFisherian} and Neyman-Pearsonian paradigms be replaced by a {neoFisherian} one. The essence of the latter is that a critical [alpha] (probability of type I error) is not specified, the terms 'significant' and 'non-significant' are abandoned, that high P values lead only to suspended judgments, and that the so-called "three-valued logic" of Cox, Kaiser, Tukey, Tryon and Harris is adopted explicitly. Confidence intervals and bands, power analyses, and severity curves remain useful adjuncts in particular situations. Analyses conducted under this paradigm we term {neoFisherian} significance assessments ({NFSA}). Their role is assessment of the existence, sign and magnitude of statistical effects. The common label of null hypothesis significance tests ({NHST}) is retained for {paleoFisherian} and Neyman-Pearsonian approaches and their hybrids. The original Neyman-Pearson framework has no utility outside quality control type applications. Some advocates of Bayesian, likelihood and information-theoretic approaches to model selection have argued that P values and {NFSAs} are of little or no value, but those arguments do not withstand critical review. Champions of Bayesian methods in particular continue to overstate their value and relevance.},

	abstract = {The anthropological record indicates that approximately 85 per cent of human societies have permitted men to have more than one wife (polygynous marriage), and both empirical and evolutionary considerations suggest that large absolute differences in wealth should favour more polygynous marriages. Yet, monogamous marriage has spread across Europe, and more recently across the globe, even as absolute wealth differences have expanded. Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis that the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been favoured by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effects—promoting success in inter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of unmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. By assuaging the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy decreases (i) the spousal age gap, (ii) fertility, and (iii) gender inequality. By shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child investment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative monogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide. These predictions are tested using converging lines of evidence from across the human sciences.},

The present work simulates the nuclear quantum mechanical ({NQM}) effects and the corresponding {KIE} in dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) and two of its mutants by using the empirical valence bond ({EVB}) and the quantum classical path ({QCP}) centroid path integral approach. Our simulations reproduce the overall observed trend while using a fully microscopic rather than a phenomenological picture and provide an interesting insight. It appears that the {KIE} increases when the distance between the donor and acceptor increases, in a somewhat counter intuitive way. The temperature dependence of the {KIE} appears to reflect mainly the temperature dependence of the distance between the donor and acceptor. This trend is also obtained from a simplified vibronic treatment, but as demonstrated here, the vibronic treatment is not valid at short and medium distances, where it is essential to use the path integral or other approaches capable of moving seamlessly from the adiabatic to the diabatic limits. It is pointed out that although the {NQM} effects do not contribute to catalysis in {DHFR}, the observed temperature dependence can be used to refine the potential of mean force for the donor and acceptor distance and its change due to distanced mutations.},

A maximum-likelihood propagator-based method allows us to extract accurate rates for the transitions between the different conformational states of the small helix-forming peptide Ala5. Assigning the conformational states by using transition paths instead of instantaneous molecular coordinates suppresses the effects of fast non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equations are validated by comparing their analytical correlation functions with those obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the master equations properly capture the character and relaxation times of the entire spectrum of conformational relaxation processes. By using the eigenvectors of the transition rate matrix, we are able to systematically coarse-grain the system. We find that a two-state description, with a folded and an unfolded state, roughly captures the slow conformational dynamics. A four-state model, with two folded and two unfolded states, accurately recovers the three slowest relaxation process with time scales between 1.5 and 7 ns. The master equation models not only give access to the slow conformational dynamics but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the helix-coil transition.},

These interactions in turn give rise to dynamic structural correlations over a wide range of time scales. Accurate analysis of these complex correlations is crucial for understanding biomolecular mechanisms and for relating structure to function. Here we report a highly accurate technique for inferring the major modes of structural correlation in macromolecules using likelihood-based statistical analysis of sets of structures. This method is generally applicable to any ensemble of related molecules, including families of nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) models, different crystal forms of a protein, and structural alignments of homologous proteins, as well as molecular dynamics trajectories. Dominant modes of structural correlation are determined using principal components analysis ({PCA}) of the maximum likelihood estimate of the correlation matrix. The correlations we identify are inherently independent of the statistical uncertainty and dynamic heterogeneity associated with the structural coordinates. We additionally present an easily interpretable method ("{PCA} plots") for displaying these positional correlations by color-coding them onto a macromolecular structure. Maximum likelihood {PCA} of structural superpositions, and the structural {PCA} plots that illustrate the results, will facilitate the accurate determination of dynamic structural correlations analyzed in diverse fields of structural biology.},

Its role in helping researchers to make reliable inference from their work and its contribution to the scientific process cannot be doubted, but can be improved. There is a widespread and pervasive misunderstanding of P-values that limits their utility as a guide to inference, and a change in the manner in which P-values are specified and interpreted will lead to improved outcomes. This paper explains the distinction between Fisher's P-values, which are local indices of evidence against the null hypothesis in the results of a particular experiment, and Neyman-Pearson α levels, which are global rates of false positive errors from unrelated experiments taken as an aggregate. The vast majority of papers published in pharmacological journals specify P-values, either as exact-values or as being less than a value (usually 0.05), but they are interpreted in a hybrid manner that detracts from their Fisherian role as indices of evidence without gaining the control of false positive and false negative error rate offered by a strict Neyman-Pearson approach. An informed choice between those approaches offers substantial advantages to the users of statistical tests over the current accidental hybrid approach.},

	abstract = {The structural origin of enzyme adaptation to low temperature, allowing efficient catalysis of chemical reactions even near the freezing point of water, remains a fundamental puzzle in biocatalysis. A remarkable universal fingerprint shared by all cold-active enzymes is a reduction of the activation enthalpy accompanied by a more negative entropy, which alleviates the exponential decrease in chemical reaction rates caused by lowering of the temperature. Herein, we explore the role of protein surface mobility in determining this enthalpy–entropy balance. The effects of modifying surface rigidity in cold-and warm-active trypsins are demonstrated here by calculation of high-precision Arrhenius plots and thermodynamic activation parameters for the peptide hydrolysis reaction, using extensive computer simulations. The protein surface flexibility is systematically varied by applying positional restraints, causing the remarkable effect of turning the cold-active trypsin into a variant with mesophilic characteristics without changing the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, we show that just restraining a key surface loop causes the same effect as a point mu-tation in that loop between the cold-and warm-active trypsin. Importantly, changes in the activation enthalpy–entropy balance of up to 10 kcal/mol are almost perfectly balanced at room tem-perature, whereas they yield significantly higher rates at low tem-peratures for the cold-adapted enzyme. enzyme cold adaptation {\textbar} thermodynamic activation parameters {\textbar} empirical valence bond {\textbar} temperature dependence {\textbar} molecular dynamics C old-adapted enzymes are able to catalyze their reactions with chemical rates comparable to and often exceeding those of their warm-active counterparts, and they are a remarkable ex-ample of how evolution can tune the biophysical properties of en-zymes.

	abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) mediate cellular responses to various hormones and neurotransmitters and are important targets for treating a wide spectrum of diseases. Although significant advances have been made in structural studies of {GPCRs}, details of their activation mechanism remain unclear. The X-ray crystal structure of the M2 muscarinic receptor, a key {GPCR} that regulates human heart rate and contractile forces of cardiomyocytes, was determined recently in an inactive antagonist-bound state. Here, activation of the M2 receptor is directly observed via accelerated molecular dynamics simulation, in contrast to previous microsecond-timescale conventional molecular dynamics simulations in which the receptor remained inactive. Receptor activation is characterized by formation of a Tyr206(5.58)-Tyr440(7.53) hydrogen bond and ∼6-{\textbackslash}{AA} outward tilting of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane α-helix 6, preceded by relocation of Trp400(6.48) toward Phe195(5.47) and Val199(5.51) and flipping of Tyr430(7.43) away from the ligand-binding cavity. Network analysis reveals that communication in the intracellular domains is greatly weakened during activation of the receptor. Together with the finding that residue motions in the ligand-binding and G-protein-coupling sites of the apo receptor are correlated, this result highlights a dynamic network for allosteric regulation of the M2 receptor activation.},

Although the 2 class I synthetases have remarkably different interactions with their cognate {tRNAs}, the allosteric networks for charging {tRNA} with the correct amino acid display considerable similarities. A dynamic contact map defines the edges connecting nodes (amino acids and nucleotides) in the physical network whose overall topology is presented as a network of communities, local substructures that are highly intraconnected, but loosely interconnected. Whereas nodes within a single community can communicate through many alternate pathways, the communication between monomers in different communities has to take place through a smaller number of critical edges or interactions. Consistent with this analysis, there are a large number of suboptimal paths that can be used for communication between the identity elements on the {tRNAs} and the catalytic site in the {aaRS}:{tRNA} complexes. Residues and nucleotides in the majority of pathways for intercommunity signal transmission are evolutionarily conserved and are predicted to be important for allosteric signaling. The same monomers are also found in a majority of the suboptimal paths. Modifying these residues or nucleotides has a large effect on the communication pathways in the protein:{RNA} complex consistent with kinetic data.},

As the number of tests increases, power for an individual test may become unacceptably low. This is a consequence of minimizing the chance of making even a single type I error, which is the aim of, for instance, the Bonferroni and sequential Bonferroni procedures. An alternative approach, control of the false discovery rate ({FDR}), has recently been advocated for ecological studies. This approach aims at controlling the proportion of significant results that are in fact type I errors. Keeping the proportion of type I errors low among all significant results is a sensible, powerful, and easy-to-interpret way of addressing the multiple testing issue. To encourage practical use of the approach, in this note we illustrate how the proposed procedure works, we compare it to more traditional methods that control the familywise error rate, and we discuss some recent useful developments in {FDR} control.},

	abstract = {We describe a new paradigm for modeling proteins in interactive computer graphics systems–continual maintenance of a physically valid representation, combined with direct user control and visualization. This is achieved by a fast algorithm for energy minimization, capable of real-time performance on all atoms of a small protein, plus graphically specified user tugs. The modeling system, called Sculpt, rigidly constrains bond lengths, bond angles, and planar groups (similar to existing interactive modeling programs), while it applies elastic restraints to minimize the potential energy due to torsions, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals and electrostatic interactions (similar to existing batch minimization programs), and user-specified springs. The graphical interface can show bad and/or favorable contacts, and individual energy terms can be turned on or off to determine their effects and interactions. Sculpt finds a local minimum of the total energy that satisfies all the constraints using an augmented Lagrange-multiplier method; calculation time increases only linearly with the number of atoms because the matrix of constraint gradients is sparse and banded. On a 100-{MHz} {MIPS} R4000 processor (Silicon Graphics Indigo), Sculpt achieves 11 updates per second on a 20-residue fragment and 2 updates per second on an 80-residue protein, using all atoms except non-H-bonding hydrogens, and without electrostatic interactions. Applications of Sculpt are described: to reverse the direction of bundle packing in a designed 4-helix bundle protein, to fold up a 2-stranded beta-ribbon into an approximate beta-barrel, and to design the sequence and conformation of a 30-residue peptide that mimics one partner of a protein subunit interaction. Computer models that are both interactive and physically realistic (within the limitations of a given force field) have 2 significant advantages: (1) they make feasible the modeling of very large changes (such as needed for de novo design), and (2) they help the user understand how different energy terms interact to stabilize a given conformation. The Sculpt paradigm combines many of the best features of interactive graphical modeling, energy minimization, and actual physical models, and we propose it as an especially productive way to use current and future increases in computer speed.},

Focusing on {STP}'s anticipated oil resources, I ask what political forms, objects and effects are generated by what some consider a disaster in the making. I trace the role of anticipation as a specific temporal disposition, particularly among Santomean state officials and members of civil society, which substitutes fresh certainties and uncertainties about what oil might bring. These include suspicions and uncertainties regarding the operations of anticipation itself. Suspicion, I suggest, is not the target of anticipation but implicated in its practice and may even call it into doubt, thus redirecting anticipation against itself.},

Recent developments in statistical methods for computation of direct evolutionary couplings between amino acids within and across polypeptide chains have allowed for inference of native residue contacts, informing accurate prediction of protein folds and multimeric structures. In this study, we assess the use of distances between evolutionarily coupled residues as natural choices for reaction coordinates which can be incorporated into Markov state model-based adaptive sampling schemes and potentially used to predict not only functional conformations but also pathways of conformational change, protein folding, and protein-protein association. We demonstrate the utility of evolutionary couplings in sampling and predicting activation pathways of the β 2-adrenergic receptor (β 2-{AR}), folding of the {FiP}35 {WW} domain, and dimerization of the E. coli molybdopterin synthase subunits. We find that the time required for β 2-{AR} activation and folding of the {WW} domain are greatly diminished using evolutionary couplings-guided adaptive sampling. Additionally, we were able to identify putative molybdopterin synthase association pathways and near-crystal structure complexes from protein-protein association simulations.},

In such settings, nonparametric methods may be favored over parametric ones. Additionally, there is a need for statistical methods that control an overall error rate for multiple hypothesis testing. We review univariate and multivariate nonparametric hypothesis tests and apply them to longitudinal data to assess changes over time in 31 biomarkers measured from the gingival crevicular fluid in 22 subjects whereby gingivitis was induced by temporarily withholding tooth brushing. To identify biomarkers that can be induced to change, multivariate Wilcoxon signed rank tests for a set of four summary measures based upon area under the curve are applied for each biomarker and compared to their univariate counterparts. Multiple hypothesis testing methods with choice of control of the false discovery rate or strong control of the family-wise error rate are examined.},

Investigating these functional conformational changes is therefore essential for understanding the corresponding biological processes and promoting bioengineering applications and rational drug design. Constructing Markov State Models ({MSMs}) based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations has emerged as a powerful approach to model functional conformational changes of the biomolecular system with sufficient resolution in both time and space. However, the rapid development of theory and algorithms for constructing {MSMs} has made it difficult for nonexperts to understand and apply the {MSM} framework, necessitating a comprehensive guidance toward its theory and practical usage. In this study, we introduce the {MSM} theory of conformational dynamics based on the projection operator scheme. We further propose a general protocol of constructing {MSM} to investigate functional conformational changes, which integrates the state-of-the-art techniques for building and optimizing initial pathways, performing adaptive sampling and constructing {MSMs}. We anticipate this protocol to be widely applied and useful in guiding nonex-perts to study the functional conformational changes of large biomolecular systems via the {MSM} framework. We also discuss the current limitations of {MSMs} and some alternative methods to alleviate them.},

Extensive simulations are used to demonstrate the reasons that render order selection particularly challenging in practice despite the conceptual simplicity of the task. In particular, we demonstrate why well-established formal procedures for model selection, such as those based on standard information criteria, tend to favor models with numbers of states that are undesirably large in situations where states shall be meaningful entities. We also offer a pragmatic step-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners can implement order selection.

	abstract = {Single-molecule force spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the kinetic behavior of biomolecules. Through application of an external force, conformational states with small or transient populations can be stabilized, allowing them to be characterized and the statistics of individual trajectories studied to provide insight into biomolecular folding and function. Because the observed quantity (force or extension) is not necessarily an ideal reaction coordinate, individual observations cannot be uniquely associated with kinetically distinct conformations. While maximum-likelihood schemes such as hidden Markov models have solved this problem for other classes of single-molecule experiments by using temporal information to aid in the inference of a sequence of distinct conformational states, these methods do not give a clear picture of how precisely the model parameters are determined by the data due to instrument noise and finite-sample statistics, both significant problems in force spectroscopy. We solve this problem through a Bayesian extension that allows the experimental uncertainties to be directly quantified, and build in detailed balance to further reduce uncertainty through physical constraints. We illustrate the utility of this approach in characterizing the three-state kinetic behavior of an {RNA} hairpin in a stationary optical trap.},

These include Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), Parkinson's disease ({PD}), and dementia with Lewy bodies ({DLB}). In {AD}, misfolded amyloid β peptide 1–42 (Aβ), a pro-teolytic product of amyloid precursor protein metabolism, accumulates in the neuronal endo-plasmic reticulum and extracellularly as plaques. In contrast, in {PD} and {DLB} cases there is abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies, axons, and synapses. Further-more, in {DLB}, Aβ 1–42 may promote α-synuclein accumulation and neurodegeneration. The central event leading to synaptic and neuronal loss in these diseases is not completely clear yet; however, recent advances in the field suggest that nerve damage might result from the con-version of nontoxic monomers to toxic oligomers and protofibrils. The mechanisms by which misfolded Aβ peptide and α-synuclein might lead to synapse loss are currently under investi-gation. Several lines of evidence support the possibility that Aβ peptide and α-synuclein might interact to cause mitochondrial and plasma membrane damage upon translocation of protofib-rils to the membranes. Accumulation of Aβ and α-synuclein oligomers in the mitochondrial membrane might result in the release of cytochrome C with the subsequent activation of the apoptosis cascade. Conversely, the oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with {AD} and {PD} may also lead to increased membrane permeability and cytochrome C release, which promotes Aβ and α-synuclein oligomerization and neurodegeneration. Together, these studies suggest that the translocation of misfolded proteins to the mitochondrial membrane might play an important role in either triggering or perpetuating neurodegeneration.

	abstract = {A growing number of postdoctoral academics cite stressful working conditions for considering abandoning their studies and leaving the academic profession entirely before they obtain a tenured position. This paper identifies the mechanisms by which work stress influences postdocs' intentions to leave academia. Based on Schaubroeck et al.'s(1989) stress-turnover-intention model, we propose a professional turnover-intention model that includes both the effort-reward imbalance model as a comprehensive measure of work stress and affective professional commitment. The research model is tested using structural equation modeling ({SEM}) and data from 421 postdocs. The results show significant support for the hypothesized effects. In particular, a three-path-mediated effect is found from work stress to the intention to leave academia via strain and job satisfaction. Additional analyses reveal significant gender differences: The relationship between overcommitment and strain is stron- ger for female postdocs than it is for male postdocs, and the direct link between work stress and the intention to leave academia applies only to female postdocs. Further, job satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between affective professional commitment and the intention to leave academia. Thus, we provide a model on an academics' professional turnover intention that goes beyond previous research by incorporating two important mediators, strain and job satisfaction. We also confirm the relevance of affective professional commitment to profes- sional turnover intentions in the realm of academia. Specific policy recommendations for retaining},

Using cross-validation to assess the number of hidden states allows to circumvent the well documented technical difficulties of the order identification problem in mixture models. Moreover, in a predictive perspective, it does not require that the sampling distribution belongs to one of the models in competition. However, computing cross-validated likelihood for hidden Markov chains involves difficulties since the data are not independent. Two approaches are proposed to compute cross-validated likelihood for a hidden Markov chain. The first one consists of using a deterministic half-sampling procedure, and the second one consists of an adaptation of the {EM} algorithm for hidden Markov chains, to take into account randomly missing values induced by cross-validation. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data sets compare different versions of cross-validated likelihood criterion and penalised likelihood criteria, including {BIC} and a penalised marginal likelihood criterion. Those numerical experiments hightlight a promising behaviour of the deterministic half-sampling criterion.},

However, there are ways to compromise a system based on biometric verification. This article focuses on the drawbacks and risks of biometric verification, specifically verification based on fingerprints. It shows how all currently available fingerprint scanners can be fooled by dummies that are created with very limited means and skills. This article should be read as a warning to those thinking of using new methods of identification without first examining the technical opportunities for compromising the identification mechanism and the associated legal consequences.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules produce a very high dimensional time-series dataset. Performing analysis necessarily involves projection onto a lower dimensional space. A priori selection of projection coordinates requires (perhaps unavailable) prior information or intuition about the system. At best, such a projection can only confirm the intuition. At worst, a poor projection can obscure new features of the system absent from the intuition. Previous statistical methods such a time-structure based independent component analysis ({tICA}) and Markov state modeling ({MSMs}) have offered relatively unbiased means of projecting conformations onto coordinates or state labels, respectively. These analyses are underpinned by the propagator formalism and the assumption that slow dynamics are biologically interesting. Although arising from the same mathematics, {tICA} and {MSMs} have different strengths and weaknesses. We introduce a unifying method which we term “landmark kernel {tICA}” ({lktICA}) which uses a variant of the Nyström kernel approximation to permit approximate non-linear solutions to the {tICA} problem. We show that {lktICA} is equivalent to {MSMs} with “soft” states. We demonstrate the advantages of this united method by finding improved projections of (a) a 1D potential surface (b) a peptide folding trajectory and (c) an ion channel conformational change.},

Section 2 centers on Figure 2, which organizes a wide class of priors on the unknown Level-{II} hyperparameters that have been proved to yield admissible Model-I minimax shrinkage estimators in the “equal variance case.” Putting a flat prior on the Level-{II} variance is unique in this class for its scale-invariance and for its conjugacy, and it induces Stein's harmonic prior ({SHP}) on μi.},

We study feature selection by thresholding of feature Z-scores and introduce a principle of threshold selection, based on the notion of higher criticism ({HC}). For i = 1, 2, ..., p, let pi(i) denote the two-sided P-value associated with the ith feature Z-score and pi((i)) denote the ith order statistic of the collection of P-values. The {HC} threshold is the absolute Z-score corresponding to the P-value maximizing the {HC} objective (i/p - pi((i)))/sqrt\{i/p(1-i/p)\}. We consider a rare/weak ({RW}) feature model, where the fraction of useful features is small and the useful features are each too weak to be of much use on their own. {HC} thresholding ({HCT}) has interesting behavior in this setting, with an intimate link between maximizing the {HC} objective and minimizing the error rate of the designed classifier, and very different behavior from popular threshold selection procedures such as false discovery rate thresholding ({FDRT}). In the most challenging {RW} settings, {HCT} uses an unconventionally low threshold; this keeps the missed-feature detection rate under better control than {FDRT} and yields a classifier with improved misclassification performance. Replacing cross-validated threshold selection in the popular Shrunken Centroid classifier with the computationally less expensive and simpler {HCT} reduces the variance of the selected threshold and the error rate of the constructed classifier. Results on standard real datasets and in asymptotic theory confirm the advantages of {HCT}.},

It can be achieved by regularization methods, which realize a trade-off between the clustering accuracy and the number of selected variables by using a lasso-type penalty. However, the calibration of the penalty term can suffer from criticisms. Model selection methods are an efficient alternative, yet they require a difficult optimization of an information criterion which involves combinatorial problems. First, most of these optimization algorithms are based on a suboptimal procedure (e.g. stepwise method). Second, the algorithms are often greedy because they need multiple calls of {EM} algorithms. Here we propose to use a new information criterion based on the integrated complete-data likelihood. It does not require any estimate and its maximization is simple and computationally efficient. The original contribution of our approach is to perform the model selection without requiring any parameter estimation. Then, parameter inference is needed only for the unique selected model. This approach is used for the variable selection of a Gaussian mixture model with conditional independence assumption. The numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method often outperforms two classical approaches for variable selection.},

We recommend dropping the {NHST} paradigm–and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it–as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to "ban" p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors.

These methods rely on a probabilistic model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process ({GP}), upon which an acquisition function is built. The acquisition function guides the optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective at a new point. {GPs} assume continous input variables. When this is not the case, for example when some of the input variables take categorical or integer values, one has to introduce extra approximations. Consider a suggested input location taking values in the real line. Before doing the evaluation of the objective, a common approach is to use a one hot encoding approximation for categorical variables, or to round to the closest integer, in the case of integer-valued variables. We show that this can lead to problems in the optimization process and describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are categorical or integer-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard {BO} methods using Gaussian processes on problems with categorical or integer-valued variables.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11222-017-9790-2},
	abstract = {We introduce stochastic models for continuous-time evolution of angles and develop their estimation. We focus on studying Langevin diffusions with stationary distributions equal to well-known distributions from directional statistics, since such diffusions can be regarded as toroidal analogues of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Their likelihood function is a product of transition densities with no analytical expression, but that can be calculated by solving the Fokker-Planck equation numerically through adequate schemes. We propose three approximate likelihoods that are computationally tractable: (i) a likelihood based on the stationary distribution; (ii) toroidal adaptations of the Euler and Shoji-Ozaki pseudo-likelihoods; (iii) a likelihood based on a specific approximation to the transition density of the wrapped normal process. A simulation study compares, in dimensions one and two, the approximate transition densities to the exact ones, and investigates the empirical performance of the approximate likelihoods. Finally, two diffusions are used to model the evolution of the backbone angles of the 1GB1 protein during a molecular dynamics simulation. The software package sdetorus implements the estimation methods and applications presented in the paper.},

(1) We show that constant {SGD} can be used as an approximate Bayesian posterior inference algorithm. Specifically, we show how to adjust the tuning parameters of constant {SGD} to best match the stationary distribution to a posterior, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these two distributions. (2) We demonstrate that constant {SGD} gives rise to a new variational {EM} algorithm that optimizes hyperparameters in complex probabilistic models. (3) We also propose {SGD} with momentum for sampling and show how to adjust the damping coefficient accordingly. (4) We analyze {MCMC} algorithms. For Langevin Dynamics and Stochastic Gradient Fisher Scoring, we quantify the approximation errors due to finite learning rates. Finally (5), we use the stochastic process perspective to give a short proof of why Polyak averaging is optimal. Based on this idea, we propose a scalable approximate {MCMC} algorithm, the Averaged Stochastic Gradient Sampler.},

The objective of pilot studies is to provide sufficient evidence that a larger definitive trial can be undertaken and, at times, to provide a preliminary assessment of benefit. We describe significance thresholds, confidence intervals and surrogate markers in the context of pilot studies and how Bayesian methods can be used in pilot trials. We use a worked example to illustrate the issues raised. We show how significance levels other than the traditional 5\% should be considered to provide preliminary evidence for efficacy and how estimation and confidence intervals should be the focus to provide an estimated range of possible treatment effects. We also illustrate how Bayesian methods could also assist in the early assessment of a health technology. We recommend that in pilot trials the focus should be on descriptive statistics and estimation, using confidence intervals, rather than formal hypothesis testing and that confidence intervals other than 95\% confidence intervals, such as 85\% or 75\%, be used for the estimation. The confidence interval should then be interpreted with regards to the minimum clinically important difference. We also recommend that Bayesian methods be used to assist in the interpretation of pilot trials. Surrogate endpoints can also be used in pilot trials but they must reliably predict the overall effect on the clinical outcome.},

Working with the generator of Markov processes, we prove that for some of the most commonly used performance criteria, i.e., spectral gap, asymptotic variance and large deviation functionals, sampling is improved for appropriate reversible and irreversible perturbations of some initially given reversible sampler. Moreover we provide specific constructions for such reversible and irreversible perturbations for various commonly used Markov processes, such as Markov chains and diffusions. In the case of diffusions, we make the discussion more specific using the large deviations rate function as a measure of performance.},

	abstract = {The nucleosome has a central role in the compaction of genomic {DNA} and the control of {DNA} accessibility for transcription and replication. To help understanding the mechanism of nucleosome opening and closing in these processes, we studied the disassembly of mononucleosomes by quantitative single-molecule {FRET} with high spatial resolution, using the {SELEX}-generated "Widom 601" positioning sequence labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores. Reversible dissociation was induced by increasing {NaCl} concentration. At least 3 species with different {FRET} were identified and assigned to structures: (i) the most stable high-{FRET} species corresponding to the intact nucleosome, (ii) a less stable mid-{FRET} species that we attribute to a first intermediate with a partially unwrapped {DNA} and less histones, and (iii) a low-{FRET} species characterized by a very broad {FRET} distribution, representing highly unwrapped structures and free {DNA} formed at the expense of the other 2 species. Selective {FCS} analysis indicates that even in the low-{FRET} state, some histones are still bound to the {DNA}. The interdye distance of 54.0 A measured for the high-{FRET} species corresponds to a compact conformation close to the known crystallographic structure. The coexistence and interconversion of these species is first demonstrated under non-invasive conditions. A geometric model of the {DNA} unwinding predicts the presence of the observed {FRET} species. The different structures of these species in the disassembly pathway map the energy landscape indicating major barriers for 10-bp and minor ones for 5-bp {DNA} unwinding steps.},

Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computational model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian energy landscape tilting ({BELT}) scheme for computing Bayesian hyperensembles over conformational ensembles. {BELT} uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply {BELT} to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, {CHARMM}27, and {OPLS}-{AA}. {BELT} incorporation of limited chemical shift and3J measurements gives convergent values of the peptide's α, β, and {PPIIconformational} populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five {BELT} hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accurate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. {BELT}'s principled framework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data. © 2014 Biophysical Society.},

A comparison is made of in vacuo dynamics results from the stochastic boundary method and a full conventional molecular dynamics simulation of lysozyme. Excellent agreement between the two approaches is obtained. The influence of solvent on the residues in the active site region is explored and it is shown that both the structure and dynamics are affected. Of particular importance for the structure of the protein is the solvation of polar residues and the stabilization of like-charged ion pairs. The magnitude of the fluctuations is only slightly altered by the solvent; the overall increase in the root-mean-square fluctuations, relative to the vacuum run, is 11\%. The solvent effect on dynamical properties is found not to be simply related to the solvent viscosity. Both the solvent exposure and dynamic aspects of protein-solvent interactions, including the relative time scales of the motions, are shown to play a role. The effects of the protein on solvent dynamics and structure are also observed to be significant. The solvent molecules around atoms in charged, polar and apolar side-chains show markedly different diffusion coefficients as well as exhibiting different solvation structures. One key example is the water around apolar groups, which is much less mobile than bulk water, or water solvating polar groups. © 1989.},

	abstract = {We have performed molecular dynamics simulations on a set of nine unfolded conformations of the fastest-folding protein yet discovered, a variant of the villin headpiece subdomain ({HP}-35 {NleNle}). The simulations were generated using a new distributed computing method, yielding hundreds of trajectories each on a time scale comparable to the experimental folding time, despite the large (10,000 atom) size of the simulation system. This strategy eliminates the need to assume a two-state kinetic model or to build a Markov state model. The relaxation to the folded state at 300 K from the unfolded configurations (generated by simulation at 373 K) was monitored by a method intended to reflect the experimental observable (quenching of tryptophan by histidine). We also monitored the relaxation to the native state by directly comparing structural snapshots with the native state. The rate of relaxation to the native state and the number of resolvable kinetic time scales both depend upon starting structure. Moreover, starting structures with folding rates most similar to experiment show some native-like structure in the N-terminal helix (helix 1) and the phenylalanine residues constituting the hydrophobic core, suggesting that these elements may exist in the experimentally relevant unfolded state. Our large-scale simulation data reveal kinetic complexity not resolved in the experimental data. Based on these findings, we propose additional experiments to further probe the kinetics of villin folding. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An efficient iterative optimization procedure has been developed to determine optimized structures and minimum energy paths for a system with thousands of atoms on the ab initio {QM}/{MM} potential: the small {QM} sub-system is optimized using a quasi-Newton minimizer in redundant internal coordinates with ab initio {QM}/{MM} calculations, while the large {MM} sub-system is minimized by the truncated Newton method in Cartesian coordinates with only molecular mechanical calculations. The above two optimization procedures are performed iteratively until they converge. With the determined minimum energy paths, free energy perturbation calculations are carried out to determine the change in free energy along the reaction coordinate. Critical to the success of the iterative optimization procedure and the free energy calculations is the smooth connection between the {QM} and {MM} regions provided by a recently proposed pseudobond {QM}/{MM} approach [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 46 (1999)]. The methods have been demonstrated by studying the initial proton transfer step in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme triosephosphate isomerase ({TIM}).

As a practical implementation of this concept, we define the transmission coefficient for any conformation to be the probability for a chain with the given conformation to fold before it unfolds. Since the transmission coefficient can serve as the best possible measure of kinetic distance for a system, we present two methods by which we can determine how closely any parameter of the system approximates the transmission coefficient. As we determine that the transmission coefficient for a short-chain heteropolymer system is dominated by entropic factors, we have chosen to illustrate the methods mentioned by applying them to geometrical properties of the system such as the number of native contacts and the looplength distribution. We find that these coordinates are not good approximations of the transmission coefficient and therefore, cannot adequately describe the kinetics of protein folding.

Markov state models are well suited to describe both, stationary properties and properties of slow dynamical processes of a molecular system, in terms of a transition matrix for a jump process on a suitable discretiza- tion of continuous conformation space. Here, we introduce statistical estimation methods that allow a priori knowledge of equilibrium probabilities to be incorporated into the estimation of dynamical observables.

These tests are compared experimentally to determine their prob- ability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of type I error in certain situations and should never be used: a test for the difference of two proportions and a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train-test splits. A third test, a paired- differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, {McNemar}'s test, is shown to have low type I error. The fth test is a new test, 5 {\textbackslash}pounds 2 cv, based on ve iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validated t test is the most powerful. The 5 {\textbackslash}pounds2 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than {McNemar}'s test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, Mc- Nemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 {\textbackslash}pounds 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.},

To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions. The authors apply this method to three peptides in explicit solvent-terminally blocked alanine, the 21-residue helical F(s) peptide, and the engineered 12-residue beta-hairpin trpzip2-to assess its ability to generate physically meaningful states and faithful kinetic models.},

However, the search for saddle points often involves hundreds or thousands of ab initio force calls, which are typically all done at full accuracy. This results in the vast majority of the computational effort being spent calculating the electronic structure of states not important to the researcher, and very little time performing the calculation of the saddle point state itself. In this work, we describe how machine learning ({ML}) can reduce the number of intermediate ab initio calculations needed to locate saddle points. Since machine-learning models can learn from, and thus mimic, atomistic simulations, the saddle-point search can be conducted rapidly in the machine-learning representation. The saddle-point prediction can then be verified by an ab initio calculation; if it is incorrect, this strategically has identified regions of the {PES} where the machine-learning representation has insufficient training data. When these training data are used to improve the machine-learning model, the estimates greatly improve. This approach can be systematized, and in two simple example problems we demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the number of ab initio force calls. We expect that this approach and future refinements will greatly accelerate searches for saddle points, as well as other searches on the potential energy surface, as machine-learning methods see greater adoption by the atomistics community.},

Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem ({SAT}), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming ({MIP}) solver {CPLEX}. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.},

[Science 347(6221), 530 (2015)]). This approach allows us to build a reactive potential energy surface whose balanced accuracy and efficiency considerably surpass what we could achieve otherwise. We ran molecular dynamics simulations to examine a range of observables which follow in the wake of the reactive event: energy deposition in the nascent reaction products, vibrational relaxation rates of excited {DF} in {CD}3CN solvent, equilibrium power spectra of {DF} in {CD}3CN, and time dependent spectral shifts associated with relaxation of the nascent {DF}. Many of our results are in good agreement with time-resolved experimental observations, providing evidence for the accuracy of our {MS}-{EVB} framework in treating both the solute and solute/solvent interactions. The simulations provide additional insight into the dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales that are difficult to resolve experimentally. In particular, the simulations show that (immediately following deuterium abstraction) the nascent {DF} finds itself in a non-equilibrium regime in two different respects: (1) it is highly vibrationally excited, with ∼23 kcal mol(-1) localized in the stretch and (2) its post-reaction solvation environment, in which it is not yet hydrogen-bonded to {CD}3CN solvent molecules, is intermediate between the non-interacting gas-phase limit and the solution-phase equilibrium limit. Vibrational relaxation of the nascent {DF} results in a spectral blue shift, while relaxation of the post-reaction solvation environment results in a red shift. These two competing effects mean that the post-reaction relaxation profile is distinct from what is observed when Franck-Condon vibrational excitation of {DF} occurs within a microsolvation environment initially at equilibrium. Our conclusions, along with the theoretical and parallel software framework presented in this paper, should be more broadly applicable to a range of complex reactive systems.},

With more than half a dozen definitions, it is the hardest of these quantities to understand in physical terms, but the richest in insight. There are many ramifications of observed Cp changes: The sign distinguishes apolar from polar solvation. It imparts a temperature (T) dependence to entropy and enthalpy that may change their signs and which of them dominate. Protein unfolding usually has a positive Cp, producing a maximum in stability and sometimes cold denaturation. There are two heat capacity contributions, from hydration and protein-protein interac-tions; which dominates in folding and binding is an open question. Theoretical work to date has dealt mostly with the hydration term and can account, at least semiquan-titatively, for the major Cp-related features: the positive and negative Cp of hydration for apolar and polar groups, respectively; the convergence of apolar group hydration entropy at T ≈ 112 • C; the decrease in apolar hydration Cp with increasing T; and the T-maximum in protein stability and cold denaturation.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED} In young healthy men, passive leg movement ({PLM}) elicits a robust nitric oxide ({NO})-dependent increase in leg blood flow ({LBF}), thus providing a novel approach to assess {NO}-mediated vascular function. While the magnitude of the {LBF} response to {PLM} is markedly reduced with age, the role of {NO} in this attenuated response in the elderly is unknown. Therefore, this study sought to determine the contribution of {NO} in the {PLM}-induced {LBF} with age. Fourteen male subjects (7 young, 24 ± 1 yr; and 7 old, 75 ± 3 yr) underwent {PLM} with and without {NO} synthase ({NOS}) inhibition achieved by intra-arterial infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-{NMMA}). {LBF} was determined second-by-second by Doppler ultrasound, and central hemodynamics were measured by finger photoplethysmography. {NOS} inhibition blunted the {PLM}-induced peak increase in {LBF} in the young (control: 668 ± 106; L-{NMMA} 431 ± 95 Δml/min; P = 0.03) but had no effect in the old (control: 266 ± 98; L-{NMMA} 251 ± 92 Δml/min; P = 0.59). Likewise, the magnitude of the reduction in the overall (i.e., area under the curve) {PLM}-induced {LBF} response to {NOS} inhibition was less in the old ({LBF}: -31 ± 18 ml) than the young ({LBF}: -129 ± 21 ml; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). These findings suggest that the age-associated reduction in {PLM}-induced {LBF} in the elderly is primarily due to a reduced contribution to vasodilation from {NO} and therefore support the use of {PLM} as a novel approach to assess {NO}-mediated vascular function across the lifespan.},

Many popular tests suffer from low power (5x2 cv [2]), or high Type I er- ror (Weka's 10x10 cross validation [11]). Fur- thermore, many tests show a low level of replicability, so that tests performed by dif- ferent scientists with the same pair of algo- rithms, the same data sets and the same hy- pothesis test still may present different re- sults. We show that 5x2 cv, resampling and 10 fold cv suffer from low replicability. The main complication is due to the need to use the data multiple times. As a conse- quence, independence assumptions for most hypothesis tests are violated. In this paper, we pose the case that reuse of the same data causes the effective degrees of freedom to be much lower than theoretically expected. We show how to calibrate the effective degrees of freedom empirically for various tests. Some tests are not calibratable, indicating another flaw in the design. However the ones that are calibratable all show very similar behav- ior. Moreover, the Type I error of those tests is on the mark for a wide range of circum- stances, while they show a power and replica- bility that is a considerably higher than cur- rently popular hypothesis tests.},

	abstract = {Mathematical statistics uses two major paradigms, conventional (or frequentist), and Bayesian. Bayesian methods provide a complete paradigm for both statistical inference and decision making under uncertainty. Bayesian methods may be derived from an axiomatic system, and hence provide a general, coherent methodology. Bayesian methods contain as particular cases many of the more often used frequentist procedures, solve many of the difficulties faced by conventional statistical methods, and extend the applicability of statistical methods. In particular, Bayesian methods make it possible to incorporate scientific hypothesis in the analysis (by means of the prior distribution) and may be applied to problems whose structure is too complex for conventional methods to be able to handle. The Bayesian paradigm is based on an interpretation of probability as a rational, conditional measure of uncertainty, which closely matches the sense of the word ‘probability' in ordinary language. Statistical inference about a quantity of interest is described as the modification of the uncertainty about its value in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem precisely specifies how this modification should be made. The special situation, often met in scientific reporting and public decision making, where the only acceptable information is that which may be deduced from available documented data, is addressed by objective Bayesian methods, as a particular case.},

	abstract = {The effect of distant mutations on the catalytic reaction of dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) is reexamined by empirical valence bond simulations. The simulations reproduce for the first time the changes in the observed rate constants (without the use of adjustable parameters for this purpose) and show that the changes in activation barriers are strongly correlated with the corresponding changes in the reorganization energy. The preorganization of the polar groups of enzymes is the key catalytic factor, and anticatalytic mutations destroy this preorganization. Some anticatalytic mutations in {DHFR} also increase the distance between the donor and acceptor, but this effect is not directly related to catalysis since the native enzyme and the uncatalyzed reaction in water have similar average donor-acceptor distances. Insight into the effect of a mutation is provided by constructing the relevant free energy surfaces in terms of the generalized solute-solvent coordinates. It is shown how the mutations change the reaction coordinate and the activation barrier, and it is clarified that the corresponding changes do not reflect dynamical effects. It is also pointed out that all reactions in a condensed phase involve correlated motions (both in enzymes and in solution) and that the change of such motions upon mutations is a result of the change in the shape of the multidimensional reaction path on the solute-solvent surface, rather than the reason for the change in rate constant. Thus, as far as catalysis is concerned, the change in the activation barrier is due to the change in the electrostatic preorganization energy.},

	abstract = {The biased agonism of the G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}), where in addition to a traditional G protein-signaling pathway a {GPCR} promotes intracellular signals though beta-arrestin, is a novel paradigm in pharmacology. Biochemical and biophysical studies have suggested that a {GPCR} forms a distinct ensemble of conformations signaling through the G protein and beta-arrestin. Here we report on the dynamics of the beta2 adrenergic receptor bound to the beta-arrestin and G protein-biased agonists and the empty receptor to further characterize the receptor conformational changes caused by biased agonists. We use conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics ({aMD}) simulations to explore the conformational transitions of the {GPCR} from the active state to the inactive state. We found that {aMD} simulations enable monitoring of the transition within the nanosecond time scale while capturing the known microscopic characteristics of the inactive states, such as the ionic lock, the inward position of F6.44, and water clusters. Distinct conformational states are shown to be stabilized by each biased agonist. In particular, in simulations of the receptor with the beta-arrestin-biased agonist N-cyclopentylbutanepherine, we observe a different pattern of motions in helix 7 when compared to simulations with the G protein-biased agonist salbutamol that involves perturbations of the network of interactions within the {NPxxY} motif. Understanding the network of interactions induced by biased ligands and the subsequent receptor conformational shifts will lead to development of more efficient drugs.},

	abstract = {Aromatic amine dehydrogenase ({AADH}) is the second enzyme known to possess the tryptophan tryptophylquinone ({TTQ}) prosthetic group. Its ability to catalyze the oxidative deamination of a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic amines has been investigated. Steady-state and transient kinetic studies of the reaction of {AADH} with a series of p-substituted phenylethylamines were performed to determine structure-reactivity correlations. The Km values correlated strongly with hydrophobic effects. The microscopic rate constant associated with {TTQ} reduction, k3, correlated with electronic substituent effects, particularly field/inductive effects, in a manner consistent with the formation of a carbanionic reaction intermediate in the reductive half-reaction. Transient kinetic studies were also performed with a series of p-substituted benzylamines, which were not substrates in the steady-state assay, but which did stoichiometrically reduce {TTQ}. The k3 for the reaction with benzylamines also correlated well with electronic effects. The rate constant associated with the release of the aldehyde product was also determined for the phenylethylamines and appears to be the most rate-limiting step in the overall oxidation-reduction reaction. This rate constant correlated with hydrophobic amines. This substrate specificity for aliphatic amines is opposite of that of methylamine dehydrogenase ({MADH}), the other known {TTQ} enzyme. On the basis of these studies, a reaction mechanism is proposed for {AADH}. These data are discussed in relation to the results of structure-reactivity correlation studies of the reactions catalyzed by {MADH} and two eukaryotic quinoproteins with different quinone prosthetic groups, plasma amine oxidase and lysyl oxidase.},

This new version of {PROPKA} ({PROPKA} 2.0) is, as much as possible, developed by adapting the empirical rules underlying {PROPKA} 1.0 to ligand functional groups. Thus, the speed of {PROPKA} is retained, so that the {pKa} values of all ionizable groups are computed in a matter of seconds for most proteins. This adaptation is validated by comparing {PROPKA} 2.0 predictions to experimental data for 26 protein–ligand complexes including trypsin, thrombin, three pepsins, {HIV}-1 protease, chymotrypsin, xylanase, hydroxynitrile lyase, and dihydrofolate reductase. For trypsin and thrombin, large protonation state changes ({\textbar}n{\textbar} {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.5) have been observed experimentally for 4 out of 14 ligand complexes. {PROPKA} 2.0 and Klebe's {PEOE} approach (Czodrowski P et al. J Mol Biol 2007;367:1347–1356) both identify three of the four large protonation state changes. The protonation state changes due to plasmepsin {II}, cathepsin D and endothiapepsin binding to pepstatin are predicted to within 0.4 proton units at {pH} 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. The {PROPKA} 2.0 results indicate that structural changes due to ligand binding contribute significantly to the proton uptake/release, as do residues far away from the binding site, primarily due to the change in the local environment of a particular residue and hence the change in the local hydrogen bonding network. Overall the results suggest that {PROPKA} 2.0 provides a good description of the protein–ligand interactions that have an important effect on the {pKa} values of titratable groups, thereby permitting fast and accurate determination of the protonation states of key residues and ligand functional groups within the binding or active site of a protein.

	abstract = {This work addresses the sampling issue commonly accompanying the simulation of chemical reactions. Very often the sampling is severely limited by complexity of the phase space, possibly leading to poorly converged or inaccurate free energy profiles. We explored the factors governing the completeness of reaction path sampling for the rate limiting step of phenylethylamine oxidation by lumiflavin in the gas phase, a reaction important for the pharmacology of the central nervous system. The simulations utilize the free energy perturbation sampling technique together with the empirical valence bond methodology for the free energy calculations. The simplicity of the system allows for the acquisition of fully converged free energy profiles, even for simulation free of restraints. The bottleneck for convergence is in the noticeably poorer sampling statistics in the transition state region, which is resolved by performing sufficiently long simulation to ensure reversibility of all processes accompanying the reaction. In the present case, convergence is attained in microseconds of simulation, but the required simulation time generally depends on the complexity of the potential energy surface pertinent to the reaction. Accordingly, the use of restraints reduces the complexity of the phase space, decreasing the required time by about an order of magnitude. In the case of elementary nucleophilic substitution with even simpler potential energy surface convergence is reached already at a timescale of few nanoseconds. For related biomolecular reactions embedded in an enzyme, significantly longer simulation times may be needed, rendering the sampling problem exceedingly difficult and representing a challenge for advanced sampling techniques. Accordingly, suggestions are given for optimal simulation of biomolecular reactions based on the presently employed techniques and under the aforementioned limitations.},

Understanaing and mastering the kinetics of oxygen electrocatalysis is instrumental to making use of photosynthesis, advancing solar fuels, fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries. We first present key insights, assumptions and limitations of well-known activity descriptors and reaction mechanisms in the past four decades. The turnover frequency of crystalline oxides as promising catalysts is also put into perspective with amorphous oxides and photosystem {II}. Particular attention is paid to electronic structure parameters that can potentially govern the adsorbate binding strength and thus provide simple rationales and design principles to predict new catalyst chemistries with enhanced activity. We share new perspective synthesizing mechanism and electronic descriptors developed from both molecular orbital and solid state band structure principles. We conclude with an outlook on the opportunities in future research within this rapidly developing field. Broader Context The formation of chemical bonds is an energy dense mode of storing energy. In both nature and technology, the electrochemical generation and consumption of fuels is one of the most efficient routes for energy usage. Solar and electrical energy can be stored in chemical bonds by splitting water or metal oxides to produce hydrogen and metal. These compounds can then be oxidized to produce energy when coupled to the reduction of oxygen. However, these device efficiencies are severely limited by the catalysis of oxygen electrochemical processes – namely the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, which have slow kinetics. Non-precious transition metal oxides show promise as cost-effective substitutes for noble metals in commercially viable renewable energy storage and conversion devices. Furthermore, this class of materials has ben efitted from a wealth of spectroscopic and first-principles studies in the past few decades, providing the frameworks and theories needed to understand the electronic structure and design optimal catalysts. The incredibly diverse range of chemistries and physical properties that can be explored in oxide families afford numerous degrees of freedom for conducting systematic investigations relating intrinsic mat erial properties to catalytic performance. Here, we present background on the fundamental concepts in catalysis for the rational design of transition metal perovskite oxide catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis and critically examine the current understanding a nd its impact on future directions of perovskite catalysts.},

Here, we automatically classify the cation coordination polyhedra obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. We find that, for example, with increasing concentration, octahedral coordination geometries become less favored, while the opposite is true for the trigonal prism. At high concentrations, the coordination polyhedra frequently deviate considerably from “ideal” polyhedra, because of an increased extent of interligand hydrogen-bonding, in which hydrogen bonds between two ligands, either {OH}2 or {OH}−, around the same Na+ are formed. In saturated solutions, with concentrations of about 19 mol L−1, ligands are frequently shared between multiple Na+ ions as a result of the deficiency of solvent molecules. This results in more complex structural patterns involving certain “characteristic” polyhedron connectivities, such as octahedra sharing ligands with capped trigonal prisms, and tetrahedra sharing ligands with trigonal bipyramids. The simulations were performed using a density-functional-theory-based reactive high-dimensional neural network potential, that was extensively validated against available neutron and X-ray diffraction data from the literature.},

Reperfusion has the poten-tial to salvage ischemic myocardium but paradoxically can cause injury, a phenomenon called as 'reperfusion injury' ({IR}). Standard histologic, immunohistochemical and Elisa techniques were used to study the histopathologic, oxida-tive, apoptotic and inflammatory changes in {MI} and {IR}. The {IL}-6 levels in the {LV} of the {MI} group were significantly raised as compared to the {IR} group (P=0.0008). Plasma {IL}-6 was also significantly increased in the {MI} group as com-pared to the {IR} group (P=0.031). {MI} model was also associated with increase in the neutrophil polymorphs number in the infarction related myocardium as compared to the re-perfused myocardium. A significant increase in troponin I level in the {MI} group as compared to the {IR} group is also seen (P=0.0001). Our {IR} model showed enhanced pro-apoptotic mediators like cleaved caspase-3 (P=0.005) and cytochrome c in the myocardium as compared to the {MI} model. In conclusion, myocardial damage in {MI} is mainly due to ischemic necrosis and inflammatory mechanisms while apoptosis is the main mechanism of cell death in {IR} in addition to limited ischemic necrosis.},

Here we show that it is the change in heat capacity associated with enzyme catalysis (ΔC(‡)p) and its effect on the temperature dependence of ΔG(‡) that determines the temperature dependence of enzyme activity. Through mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the Topt of an enzyme is correlated with ΔC(‡)p and that changes to ΔC(‡)p are sufficient to change Topt without affecting the catalytic rate. Furthermore, using X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations we reveal the molecular details underpinning these changes in ΔC(‡)p. The influence of ΔC(‡)p on enzymatic rates has implications for the temperature dependence of biological rates from enzymes to ecosystems.},

It has recently been demonstrated that it is possible to recover kinetics through so called `infrequent metadynamics' simulations, where the simulations are biased in a way that minimally corrupts the dynamics of moving between metastable states. This method, however, requires the bias to be added slowly, thus hampering applications to processes with only modest separations of timescales. Here we present a frequency-adaptive strategy which bridges normal and infrequent metadynamics. We show that this strategy can improve the precision and accuracy of rate calculations at fixed computational cost, and should be able to extend rate calculations for much slower kinetic processes.},

A simple procedure was given there as an {FDR} controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of prac- tical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the proce- dure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven {FDR} control can be offered is greatly increased.},

	abstract = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, e.g., allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Because correlated motions in biomolecules remain difficult to access experimentally, molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations are particular useful for their analysis. The established method to quantify correlations from {MD} simulations via calculation of the covariance matrix, however, is restricted to linear correlations and therefore misses part of the correlations in the atomic fluctuations. Herein, we propose a general statistical mechanics approach to detect and quantify any correlated motion from {MD} trajectories. This generalized correlation measure is contrasted with correlations obtained from covariance matrices for the B1 domain of protein G and T4 lysozyme. The new method successfully quantifies correlations and provides a valuable global overview over the functionally relevant collective motions of lysozyme. In particular, correlated motions of helix 1 together with the two main lobes of lysozyme are detected, which are not seen by the conventional covariance matrix. Overall, the established method misses more than 50\% of the correlation. This failure is attributed to both, an interfering and unnecessary dependence on mutual orientations of the atomic fluctuations and, to a lesser extent, attributed to nonlinear correlations. Our generalized correlation measure overcomes these problems and, moreover, allows for an improved understanding of the conformational dynamics by separating linear and nonlinear contributions of the correlation.},

	volume = {72},
	issn = {15205126},
	doi = {10.1021/ja01167a545},
	abstract = {During the past fifteen years we have been attacking the problem of the structure of proteins in several ways. One of these ways is the complete and accurate determination of the crystal structure of amino acids, peptides, and other simple substances related to proteins, in order that information about interatomic distances, bond angles, and other configurational parameters might be obtained that would permit the reliable prediction of reasonable configurations for the polypeptide chain. We have now used this information to construct two reasonable hydrogen-bonded helical configurations for the polypeptide chain; we think that it is likely that these configurations constitute an important part of the structure of both fibrous and globular proteins, as well as of synthetic polypeptides. A letter announcing their discovery was published last year.1 The problem that we have set ourselves is that of finding all hydrogen-bonded structures for a single polypeptide chain, in which the residues are equivalent (except for the differences in the side chain R). An amino acid residue (other than glycine) has no symmetry elements. The general operation of conversion of one residue of a single chain into a second residue equivalent to the first is accordingly a rotation about an axis accompanied by translation along the axis. Hence the only configurations for a chain compatible with our postulate of equivalence of the residues are helical configurations. For rotational angle 180° the helical configurations may degenerate to a simple chain with all of the principal atoms, C, C′ (the carbonyl carbon), N, and O, in the same plane. We assume that, because of the resonance of the double bond between the carbon-oxygen and carbon-nitrogen positions, the configuration of each residue is planar. This structural feature has been verified for each of the amides that we have studied. Moreover, the resonance theory is now so well grounded and its experimental substantiation so extensive that there can be no doubt whatever about its application to the amide group. The observed C—N distance, 1.32 {\textbackslash}{AA}, corresponds to nearly 50 per cent double-bond character, and we may conclude that rotation by as much as 10° from the planar configuration would result in instability by about 1 kcal. mole−1. The interatomic distances and bond angles within the residue are assumed to have the values shown in figure 1. These values have been formulated2 by consideration of the experimental values found in the crystal structure studies of {DL}-alanine,3 L-threonine,4 N-acetylglycine5, and β-glycylglycine6 that have been made in our Laboratories. It is further assumed that each nitrogen atom forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of another residue, with the nitrogen-oxygen distance equal to 2.72 {\textbackslash}{AA}, and that the vector from the nitrogen atom to the hydrogen-bonded oxygen atom lies not more than 30° from the N—H direction. The energy of an N—H · · · hydrogen bond is of the order of 8 kcal. mole−1, and such great instability would result from the failure to form these bonds that we may be confident of their presence. The N—H · · · O distance cannot be expected to be exactly 2.72 {\textbackslash}{AA}, but might deviate somewhat from this value. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download as {PowerPoint} Slide Figure 1. Dimensions of the polypeptide chain. Solution of this problem shows that there are five and only five configurations for the chain that satisfy the conditions other than that of direction of the hydrogen bond relative to the N—H direction. These correspond to the values 165°, 120°, 108°, 97.2° and 70.1° for the rotational angle. In the first, third, and fifth of these structures the group is negatively and the group positively directed along the helical axis, taken as the direction corresponding to the sequence—{CHR}—{CO}—{NH}—{CHR}—of atoms in the peptide chain, and in the other two their directions are reversed. The first three of the structures are unsatisfactory, in that the N—H group does not extend in the direction of the oxygen atom at 2.72 {\textbackslash}{AA}; the fourth and fifth are satisfactory, the angle between the N—H vector and N—O vector being about 10° and 25° for these two structures respectively. The fourth structure has 3.69 amino acid residues per turn in the helix, and the fifth structure has 5.13 residues per turn. In the fourth structure each amide group is hydrogen-bonded to the third amide group beyond it along the helix, and in the fifth structure each is bonded to the fifth amide group beyond it; we shall call these structures either the 3.7-residue structure and the 5.1-residue structure, respectively, or the third-amide hydrogen-bonded structure and the fifth-amide hydrogen-bonded structure. Drawings of the two structures are shown in figures 2, 3, 4, and 5. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download as {PowerPoint} Slide Figure 2. The helix with 3.7 residues per turn.

View larger version: In this page In a new window Download as {PowerPoint} Slide Figure 5. Plan of the 5.1-residue helix. For glycine both the 3.7-residue helix and the 5.1-residue helix could occur with either a positive or a negative rotational translation; that is, as either a positive or a negative helix, relative to the positive direction of the helical axis given by the sequence of atoms in the peptide chain. For other amino acids with the L configuration, however, the positive helix and the negative helix would differ in the position of the side chains, and it might well be expected that in each case one sense of the helix would be more stable than the other. An arbitrary assignment of the R groups has been made in the figures. The translation along the helical axis in the 3.7-residue helix is 1.47 {\textbackslash}{AA}, and that in the 5.1-residue helix is 0.99 {\textbackslash}{AA}. The values for one complete turn are 5.44 {\textbackslash}{AA} and 5.03 {\textbackslash}{AA}, respectively. These values are calculated for the hydrogen-bond distance 2.72 {\textbackslash}{AA}; they would have to be increased by a few per cent, in case that a larger hydrogen-bond distance (2.80 {\textbackslash}{AA}, say) were present. The stability of our helical structures in a non-crystalline phase depends solely on interactions between adjacent residues, and does not require that the number of residues per turn be a ratio of small integers. The value 3.69 residues per turn, for the third-amide hydrogen-bonded helix, is most closely approximated by 48 residues in thirteen turns (3.693 residues per turn), and the value 5.13 for the other helix is most closely approximated by 41 residues in eight turns. It is to be expected that the number of residues per turn would be affected somewhat by change in the hydrogen-bond distance, and also that the interaction of helical molecules with neighboring similar molecules in a crystal would cause small torques in the helixes, deforming them slightly into configurations with a rational number of residues per turn. For the third-amide hydrogen-bonded helix the simplest structures of this sort that we would predict are the 11-residue, 3-turn helix (3.67 residues per turn), the 15-residue, 4-turn helix (3.75), and the 18-residue, 5-turn helix (3.60). We have found some evidence indicating that the first and third of these slight variants of this helix exist in crystalline polypeptides. These helical structures have not previously been described. In addition to the extended polypeptide chain configuration, which for nearly thirty years has been assumed to be present in stretched hair and other proteins with the β-keratin structure, configurations for the polypeptide chain have been proposed by Astbury and Bell,7 and especially by Huggins8 and by Bragg, Kendrew, and Perutz.9 Huggins discussed a number of structures involving intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and Bragg, Kendrew, and Perutz extended the discussion to include additional structures, and investigated the compatibility of the structures with x-ray diffraction data for hemoglobin and myoglobin. None of these authors proposed either our 3.7-residue helix or our 5.1-residue helix. On the other hand, we would eliminate, by our basic postulates, all of the structures proposed by them. The reason for the difference in results obtained by other investigators and by us through essentially similar arguments is that both Bragg and his collaborators and Huggins discussed in detail only helical structures with an integral number of residues per turn, and moreover assumed only a rough approximation to the requirements about interatomic distances, bond angles, and planarity of the conjugated amide group, as given by our investigations of simpler substances. We contend that these stereochemical features must be very closely retained in stable configurations of polypeptide chains in proteins, and that there is no special stability associated with an integral number of residues per turn in the helical molecule. Bragg, Kendrew, and Perutz have described a structure topologically similar to our 3.7-residue helix as a hydrogen-bonded helix with 4 residues per turn. In their thorough comparison of their models with Patterson projections for hemoglobin and myoglobin they eliminated this structure, and drew the cautious conclusion that the evidence favors the non-helical 3-residue folded α-keratin configuration of Astbury and Bell, in which only one-third of the carbonyl and amino groups are involved in intramolecular hydrogen-bond formation. It is our opinion that the structure of α-keratin, α-myosin, and similar fibrous proteins is closely represented by our 3.7-residue helix, and that this helix also constitutes an important structural feature in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and other globular proteins, as well as of synthetic polypeptides. We think that the 5.1-residue helix may be represente},

	abstract = {© 2016 American Chemical Society. A new version of global sensitivity analysis is developed in this paper. This new version coupled with tools from statistics, machine learning, and optimization can devise small sample sizes that allow for the accurate ordering of sensitivity coefficients for the first 10-30 most sensitive chemical reactions in complex chemical-kinetic mechanisms, and is particularly useful for studying the chemistry in realistic devices. A key part of the paper is calibration of these small samples. Because these small sample sizes are developed for use in realistic combustion devices, the calibration is done over the ranges of conditions in such devices, with a test case being the operating conditions of a compression ignition engine studied earlier. Compression-ignition engines operate under low-temperature combustion conditions with quite complicated chemistry making this calibration difficult, leading to the possibility of false positives and false negatives in the ordering of the reactions. So an important aspect of the paper is showing how to handle the trade-off between false positives and false negatives using ideas from the multiobjective optimization literature. The combination of the new global sensitivity method and the calibration are sample sizes a factor of approximately 10 times smaller than were available with our previous algorithm.

We validate the {LR}-{TDDFT} method for this case and then present a detailed analysis of the first ≈200 fs of {DMABN} excited-state dynamics. Almost complete nonadiabatic population transfer from S2 (the initially populated bright state) to S1 takes place in less than 50 fs, without significant torsion of the dimethylamino ({DMA}) group. Significant torsion of the {DMA} group is only observed after the nuclear wavepacket reaches S1 and acquires locally excited electronic character.

Lett., 630, 68-75 (2015)] was recently proposed as an enhanced conformational sampling method for reproducing biologically relevant rare events of a given protein. In {TBSA}, an inverse histogram of the original distribution, mapped onto a set of reaction coordinates, is constructed from trajectories obtained by multiple short-time molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations. Rarely occurring states of a given protein are statistically selected as new initial states based on the inverse histogram, and resampling is performed by restarting the {MD} simulations from the new initial states to promote the conformational transition. In this process, the definition of the inverse histogram, which characterizes the rarely occurring states, is crucial for the efficiency of {TBSA}. In this study, we propose a simple modification of the inverse histogram to further accelerate the convergence of {TBSA}. As demonstrations of the modified {TBSA}, we applied it to (a) hydrogen bonding rearrangements of Met-enkephalin, (b) large-amplitude domain motions of Glutamine-Binding Protein, and (c) folding processes of the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus Protein A. All demonstrations numerically proved that the modified {TBSA} reproduced these biologically relevant rare events with nanosecond-order simulation times, although a set of microsecond-order, canonical {MD} simulations failed to reproduce the rare events, indicating the high efficiency of the modified {TBSA}.},

Using {DNA} polymerase I (Klenow fragment) labeled with both donor and acceptor fluorophores, we have employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to study the polymerase conformational transitions that precede nucleotide addition. Our experiments clearly distinguish the open and closed conformations that predominate in Pol-{DNA} and Pol-{DNA}-{dNTP} complexes, respectively. By contrast, the unliganded polymerase shows a broad distribution of {FRET} values, indicating a high degree of conformational flexibility in the protein in the absence of its substrates; such flexibility was not anticipated on the basis of the available crystallographic structures. Real-time observation of conformational dynamics showed that most of the unliganded polymerase molecules sample the open and closed conformations in the millisecond timescale. Ternary complexes formed in the presence of mismatched {dNTPs} or complementary ribonucleotides show unique {FRET} species, which we suggest are relevant to kinetic checkpoints that discriminate against these incorrect substrates.},

These changes can be as small as the rotation of one or a few side-chain dihedral angles or involve concerted motions in larger portions of the three-dimensional structure; both kinds of motions can be important for biological function and allostery. It is becoming increasingly evident that " connector regions " are important components of the dynamic personality of protein structures. These regions may be either disordered loops, i.e., poorly structured regions connecting secondary structural elements, or linkers that connect entire protein domains. Experimental and computational studies have, however, revealed that these regions are not mere connectors, and their role in allostery and conformational changes has been emerging in the last few decades. Here we provide a detailed overview of the structural properties and classification of loops and linkers, as well as a discussion of the main computational methods employed to investigate their function and dynamical properties. We also describe their importance for protein dynamics and allostery using as examples key proteins in cellular biology and human diseases such as kinases, ubiquitinating enzymes, and transcription factors.},

Then, the question is how many snapshots are needed to reach a reliable estimate of the energy.

The influence of dynamics in catalysis can be inferred, but not proven, by comparison of equilibrium structures of protein variants and protein-ligand complexes. A more direct way to establish connections between protein dynamics and the catalytic cycle is to probe the kinetics of specific protein motions in comparison to progress along the reaction coordinate. We have examined the enzyme model system dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) from Escherichia coli with tryptophan fluorescence-probed temperature-jump spectroscopy. We aimed to observe the kinetics of the ligand binding and ligand-induced conformational changes of three {DHFR} complexes to establish the relationship among these catalytic steps. Surprisingly, in all three complexes, the observed kinetics do not match a simple sequential two-step process. Through analysis of the relationship between ligand concentration and observed rate, we conclude that the observed kinetics correspond to the ligand binding step of the reaction and a noncoupled enzyme conformational change. The kinetics of the conformational change vary with the ligand's identity and presence but do not appear to be directly related to progress along the reaction coordinate. These results emphasize the need for kinetic studies of {DHFR} with highly specific spectroscopic probes to determine which dynamic events are coupled to the catalytic cycle and which are not.},

	abstract = {The functions of many proteins are regulated through allostery, whereby effector binding at a distal site changes the functional activity (e.g., substrate binding affinity or catalytic efficiency) at the active site. Most allosteric studies have focused on thermodynamic properties, in particular, substrate binding affinity. Changes in substrate binding affinity by allosteric effectors have generally been thought to be mediated by conformational transitions of the proteins or, alternatively, by changes in the broadness of the free energy basin of the protein conformational state without shifting the basin minimum position. When effector binding changes the free energy landscape of a protein in conformational space, the change affects not only thermodynamic properties but also dynamic properties, including the amplitudes of motions on different time scales and rates of conformational transitions. Here we assess the roles of conformational dynamics in allosteric regulation. Two cases are highlighted where {NMR} spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation have been used as complementary approaches to identify residues possibly involved in allosteric communication. Perspectives on contentious issues, for example, the relationship between picosecond-nanosecond local and microsecond-millisecond conformational exchange dynamics, are presented.},

	abstract = {One of the critical variables that determine the rate of any reaction is temperature. For biological systems, the effects of temperature are convoluted with myriad (and often opposing) contributions from enzyme catalysis, protein stability, and temperature-dependent regulation, for example. We have coined the phrase "macromolecular rate theory ({MMRT})" to describe the temperature dependence of enzyme-catalyzed rates independent of stability or regulatory processes. Central to {MMRT} is the observation that enzyme-catalyzed reactions occur with significant values of ΔCp(‡) that are in general negative. That is, the heat capacity (Cp) for the enzyme-substrate complex is generally larger than the Cp for the enzyme-transition state complex. Consistent with a classical description of enzyme catalysis, a negative value for ΔCp(‡) is the result of the enzyme binding relatively weakly to the substrate and very tightly to the transition state. This observation of negative ΔCp(‡) has important implications for the temperature dependence of enzyme-catalyzed rates. Here, we lay out the fundamentals of {MMRT}. We present a number of hypotheses that arise directly from {MMRT} including a theoretical justification for the large size of enzymes and the basis for their optimum temperatures. We rationalize the behavior of psychrophilic enzymes and describe a "psychrophilic trap" which places limits on the evolution of enzymes in low temperature environments. One of the defining characteristics of biology is catalysis of chemical reactions by enzymes, and enzymes drive much of metabolism. Therefore, we also expect to see characteristics of {MMRT} at the level of cells, whole organisms, and even ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Objective: Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence—with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies—is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices—automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables—are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

The algorithm has a simple interpretation: it alternately performs a supervised and an unsupervised step, where in the former step it learns task functions and in the latter step it learns common across tasks sparse representations for these functions. We also provide an extension of the algorithm which learns sparse nonlinear representations using kernels. We report experiments on simulated and real data sets which demonstrate that the proposed method can both improve the performance relative to learning each task independently and lead to a few learned features common across related tasks.

Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice.

However, building useful risk stratification models presents many technical challenges in-cluding the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a patient's risk of an adverse outcome and the inherent evolution of that risk over time. We address these challenges in the context of learning a risk stratification model for predicting which patients are at risk of acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection ({CDI}). We take a novel data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of {EHRs} from nearly 50,000 hospital ad-missions. We show how, by adapting techniques from multitask learning, we can learn models for patient risk stratification with unprecedented classification performance. Our model, based on thousands of variables, both time-varying and time-invariant, changes over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held out set of approximately 25,000 patient admissions, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95\% {CI} 0.78-0.84). The model has been integrated into the health record system at a large hospital in the {US}, and can be used to produce daily risk estimates for each inpatient. While more complex than traditional risk stratification methods, the widespread develop-ment and use of such data-driven models could ultimately enable cost-effective, targeted prevention strategies that lead to better patient outcomes.},

In this paper, we give a survey for {MTL}. First, we classify different {MTL} algorithms into several categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach, and decomposition approach, and then discuss the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, {MTL} can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, batch {MTL} models are difficult to handle this situation and online, parallel and distributed {MTL} models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing are reviewed to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use {MTL} to boost their performance and we review representative works. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for {MTL}.},

	abstract = {© 2013 {IEEE}. When facing multitask-learning problems, it is desirable that the learning method could find the correct input-output features and share the commonality among multiple domains and also scale-up for large multitask datasets. We introduce the multitask coupled logistic regression ({LR}) framework called {LR}-based multitask classification learning algorithm ({MTC}-{LR}), which is a new method for generating each classifier for each task, capable of sharing the commonality among multitask domains. The basic idea of {MTC}-{LR} is to use all individual {LR} based classifiers, each one appropriate for each task domain, but in contrast to other support vector machine ({SVM})-based proposals, learning all the parameter vectors of all individual classifiers by using the conjugate gradient method, in a global way and without the use of kernel trick, and being easily extended into its scaled version. We theoretically show that the addition of a new term in the cost function of the set of {LRs} (that penalizes the diversity among multiple tasks) produces a coupling of multiple tasks that allows {MTC}-{LR} to improve the learning performance in a {LR} way. This finding can make us easily integrate it with a state-of-the-art fast {LR} algorithm called dual coordinate descent method ({CDdual}) to develop its fast version {MTC}-{LR}-{CDdual} for large multitask datasets. The proposed algorithm {MTC}-{LR}-{CDdual} is also theoretically analyzed. Our experimental results on artificial and real-datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm {MTC}-{LR}-{CDdual} in classification accuracy, speed, and robustness.},

	abstract = {There are many of pathogen bacteria species which very different susceptibility profile to different antibacterial drugs. There are many drugs described with very different affinity to a large number of receptors. In this work, we selected Drug-Bacteria Pairs ({DBPs}) of affinity/non-affinity drugs with similar/dissimilar bacteria and represented it as a large network, which may be used to identify drugs that can act on bacteria. Computational chemistry prediction of the biological activity based on one-target Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (ot-{QSAR}) studies substantially increases the potentialities of this kind of networks avoiding time and resource consuming experiments. Unfortunately almost all ot-{QSAR} models predict the biological activity of drugs against only one bacterial species. Consequently, multi-tasking learning to predict drug's activity against different species with a single model (mt-{QSAR}) is a goal of major importance. These mt-{QSARs} offer a good opportunity to construct drug-drug similarity Complex Networks. Unfortunately, almost {QSAR} models are unspecific or predict activity against only one receptor. To solve this problem, we developed here a multi-bacteria {QSAR} classification model. The model correctly classifies 202 out of 241 active compounds (83.8\%) and 169 out of 200 non-active cases (84.5\%). Overall training predictability was 84.13\% (371 out of 441 cases). The validation of the model was carried out by means of external predicting series, classifying the model 197 out of 221 (89.4\%) cases. In order to show how the model functions in practice a virtual screening was carried out recognizing the model as active 86.7\%, 520 out of 600 cases not used in training or predicting series. Outputs of this {QSAR} model were used as inputs to construct a network. The observed network has 1242 nodes ({DBPs}), 772,736 edges or {DBPs} with similar activity ({sDBPs}). The network predicted has 1031 nodes, 641,377 {sDBPs}. After edge-to-edge comparison, we have demonstrated that the predicted network is significantly similar to the observed one and both have distribution closer to exponential than to normal. © 2009 Elsevier Masson {SAS}.

Because of the large number of such chemicals in the environment, there is a great need for an effective means of rapidly assessing endocrine-disrupting activity in the toxicology assessment process. When faced with the challenging task of screening large libraries of molecules for biological activity, the benefits of computational predictive models based on quantitative structure-activity relationships to identify possible estrogens become immediately obvious. Recently, in order to improve the accuracy of prediction, some machine learning techniques were introduced to build more effective predictive models. In this review we will focus our attention on some recent advances in the use of these methods in modeling estrogen-like chemicals. The advantages and disadvantages of the machine learning algorithms used in solving this problem, the importance of the validation and performance assessment of the built models as well as their applicability domains will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Given a set of biallelic molecular markers, such as {SNPs}, with genotype values encoded numerically on a collection of plant, animal or human samples, the goal of genetic trait prediction is to predict the quantitative trait values by simultaneously modeling all marker effects. Genetic trait prediction is usually represented as linear regression models. In many cases, for the same set of samples and markers, multiple traits are observed. Some of these traits might be correlated with each other. Therefore, modeling all the multiple traits together may improve the prediction accuracy. In this work, we view the multitrait prediction problem from a machine learning angle: as either a multitask learning problem or a multiple output regression problem, depending on whether different traits share the same genotype matrix or not. We then adapted multitask learning algorithms and multiple output regression algorithms to solve the multitrait prediction problem. We proposed a few strategies to improve the least square error of the prediction from these algorithms. Our experiments show that modeling multiple traits together could improve the prediction accuracy for correlated traits.

The number of fragments required for chemical accuracy is still prohibitively expensive for ab-initio {MBE} to compete with force field approximations for applications beyond single-point energies. Alongside the {MBE}, empirical models of ab-initio potential energy surfaces have improved, especially non-linear models based on neural networks ({NN}) which can reproduce ab-initio potential energy surfaces rapidly and accurately. Although they are fast, {NNs} suffer from their own curse of dimensionality; they must be trained on a representative sample of chemical space. In this paper we examine the synergy of the {MBE} and {NN}'s, and explore their complementarity. The {MBE} offers a systematic way to treat systems of arbitrary size and intelligently sample chemical space. {NN}'s reduce, by a factor in excess of \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ the computational overhead of the {MBE} and reproduce the accuracy of ab-initio calculations without specialized force fields. We show they are remarkably general, providing comparable accuracy with drastically different chemical embeddings. To assess this we test a new chemical embedding which can be inverted to predict molecules with desired properties.},

Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of {MSMs} called {MSMBUILDER} (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of {MSMBUILDER} to the villin headpiece ({HP}-35 {NleNle}), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting {MSM} captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system.

However, state-of-the-art meta-analytic approaches cannot determine the credibility of an effect because they do not account for the extent to which each included study has survived such attempted falsification. To overcome this problem, we outline a unified framework for estimating the credibility of published research by examining four fundamental falsifiability-related dimensions: (a) transparency of the methods and data, (b) reproducibility of the results when the same data-processing and analytic decisions are reapplied, (c) robustness of the results to different data-processing and analytic decisions, and (d) replicability of the effect. This framework includes a standardized workflow in which the degree to which a finding has survived scrutiny is quantified along these four facets of credibility. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to published replications in the psychology literature. Finally, we outline a Web implementation of the framework and conclude by encouraging the community of researchers to contribute to the development and crowdsourcing of this platform.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of deep learning models is a challenge due to their size, complexity, and often opaque internal state. In addition, many systems, such as image classifiers, operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors ({CAVs}), which provide an interpretation of a neural net's internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use {CAVs} as part of a technique, Testing with {CAVs} ({TCAV}), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result-for example , how sensitive a prediction of zebra is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how {CAVs} may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.},

	abstract = {After screening out inappropriate or doubtful covariates on the basis of background knowledge, one may still be left with many potential confounders. It is then tempting to use statistical variable-selection methods to reduce the number used for adjustment. Nonetheless, there is no agreement on how selection should be conducted, and it is well known that conventional selection methods lead to confidence intervals that are too narrow and p values that are too small. Furthermore, theory and simulation evidence have found no selection method to be uniformly superior to adjusting for all well-measured confounders. Nonetheless, control of all measured confounders can lead to problems for conventional model-fitting methods. When these problems occur, one can apply modern techniques such as shrinkage estimation, exposure modeling, or hybrids that combine outcome and exposure modeling. No selection or special software is needed for most of these techniques. It thus appears that statistical confounder selection may be an unnecessary complication in most regression analyses of effects.},

They are becoming widely available in standard computer packages under the headings of generalized linear mixed models, hierarchical models, and multilevel models. I here argue that such models offer a more scientifically defensible framework for epidemiologic analysis than the fixed-effects models now prevalent in epidemiology. The argument invokes an antiparsimony principle attributed t o L. J. Savage, which is that models should be rich enough t o reflect the complexity of the relations under study. It also invokes the countervailing principle that you cannot estimate anything if you try t o estimate everything (often used t o justify parsimony). Regression with random coefficients offers a rational compromise between these principles as well as an alternative to analyses based on standard variable-selection algorithms and their attendant distortion of uncertainty assessments. These points are illustrated with an analysis of data on diet, nutrition, and breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Impulse control disorders ({ICDs}) are frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease ({PD}), with potential negative effects on quality of life and social functioning. {ICDs} are closely associated with dopaminergic therapy, and genetic polymorphisms in several neurotransmitter pathways may increase the risk of addictive behaviors in {PD}. However, clinical differentiation between patients at risk and patients without risk of {ICDs} is still troublesome. The aim of this study was to investigate if genetic polymorphisms across several neurotransmitter pathways are associated with {ICD} status in patients with {PD}. Methods: Whole exome sequencing data was available for 119 eligible {PD} patients from the Norwegian {ParkWest} study. All participants underwent comprehensive neurological, neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessments. {ICDs} were assessed using the self-report short form version of the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in {PD}. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) from 17 genes were subjected to regression with elastic net-penalization to identify candidate variants associated with {ICDs}. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves was used to evaluate the level of {ICD} prediction. Results: Among the 119 patients with {PD} included in the analysis, 29\% met the criteria for {ICD} and 63\% were using dopamine agonists. Eleven {SNPs} were associated with {ICDs}, and the four {SNPs} with the most robust performance significantly increased {ICD} predictability ({AUC} = 0.81, 95\% {CI} 0.73-0.90) compared to clinical data alone (dopamine agonist use and age; {AUC} = 0.65, 95\% {CI} 0.59-0.78). The strongest predictive factors were rs5326 in {DRD}1, which was associated with increased odds of {ICDs}, and rs702764 in {OPRK}1, which was associated with decreased odds of {ICDs}. Conclusions: Using an advanced statistical approach, we identified {SNPs} in nine genes, including a novel polymorphism in {DRD}1, with potential application for identification of {PD} patients at risk for {ICDs}.},

Over the past few years, the debate has again received front-page attention, particularly through the public reminder by the American Statistical Association on how P values should be used and interpreted. At the core of the issue lies a fault in the way that scientific evidence is dichotomized and research is subsequently reported, and this fault is exacerbated by researchers giving license to statistical models to do scientific inference. This paper highlights a different approach to handling the evidence collected during a randomized controlled trial, one that does not dichotomize, but rather reports the evidence collected. Through the use of a coin flipping experiment and reanalysis of real-world data, the traditional approach of testing null hypothesis significance is contrasted with a Bayesian approach. This paper is meant to be understood by those who rely on statistical models to draw conclusions from data, but are not statisticians and may therefore not be able to grasp the debate that is primarily led by statisticians.},

	abstract = {Bayesian estimation for 2 groups provides complete distributions of credible values for the effect size, group means and their difference, standard deviations and their difference, and the normality of the data. The method handles outliers. The decision rule can accept the null value (unlike traditional t tests) when certainty in the estimate is high (unlike Bayesian model comparison using Bayes factors). The method also yields precise estimates of statistical power for various research goals. The software and programs are free and run on Macintosh, Windows, and Linux platforms. One of the most frequently encountered scientific procedures is a comparison of two groups (e.g., du Prel, Röhrig, Hommel, \& Blettner, 2010; Fritz, Morris, \& Richler, 2012; Wetzels et al., 2011). Given data from two groups, researchers ask various comparative questions: How much is one group different from an-other? Can we be reasonably sure that the difference is non-zero? How certain are we about the magnitude of difference? These questions are difficult to answer because data are contaminated by random variability despite researchers' efforts to minimize extraneous influences on the data. Because of "noise" in the data, researchers rely on statistical methods of probabilistic inference to interpret the data. When data are interpreted in terms of meaningful parameters in a mathematical description, such as the difference of mean parameters in two groups, it is Bayesian analysis that provides complete information about the credible parameter values. Bayesian analysis is also more intuitive than traditional methods of null hypothesis significance testing (e.g., Dienes, 2011). This article introduces an intuitive Bayesian approach to the analysis of data from two groups. The method yields complete distributional information about the means and standard deviations of the groups. In particular, the analysis reveals the relative credibility of every possible difference of means, every possible difference of standard deviations, and all possible effect sizes. From this explicit distribution of credible parameter values, inferences about null values can be made without ever referring to p values as in null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}). Unlike {NHST}, the Bayesian method can accept the null value, not only reject it, when certainty in the estimate is high. The new method handles outliers by describing the data as heavy tailed distributions instead of normal distributions, to the extent implied by the data. The new method also implements power analysis in both retrospective and prospective forms. The analysis is implemented in the widely used and free programming languages R and {JAGS} and can be run on Macintosh, Linux, and Windows operating systems. Complete installation instructions are provided, along with working examples. The programs can also be flexibly extended to other types of data and analyses. Thus, the software can be used by virtually anyone who has a computer. The article is divided into two main sections, followed by appendices. The first section introduces the Bayesian analysis and explains its results through examples. The richness of information provided by the Bayesian parameter estimation is emphasized. Bayesian power analysis is also illustrated. The second section contrasts the Bayesian approach with the t test from {NHST}. This section points out not only the relative poverty of information provided by the {NHST} t test but also some of its foundational logical problems. An appendix is provided for readers who are familiar with a different Bayesian approach to testing null hypotheses , which is based on model comparison and uses the Bayes factor as a decision statistic. This appendix suggests that Bayesian model comparison is usually less informative than the approach of Bayesian parameter estimation featured in the first section. The perils of {NHST} and the merits of Bayesian data analysis have been expounded with increasing force in recent years (e.g Wagenmakers, 2007). Nevertheless , some people have the impression that conclusions from {NHST} and Bayesian methods tend to agree in simple situations such as comparison of two groups: "Thus, if your primary question of interest can be simply expressed in a form amenable to a t test, say, there really is no need to try and apply the full Bayesian machinery to so simple a problem" (Brooks, 2003, p. 2694). This article shows, to the contrary, that Bayesian parameter estimation provides much richer information than the {NHST} t test and that its conclusions can differ from those of the {NHST} t test. Decisions based on Bayesian parameter estimation are better founded than those based on {NHST}, whether the decisions derived by the two methods agree or not. The conclusion is bold but simple: Bayesian parameter estimation supersedes the {NHST} t test.},

	volume = {318},
	url = {https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices},
	doi = {10.1001/jama.2017.14972},
	abstract = {In this issue of {JAMA}, Laptook et al 1 report the results of a clinical trial investigating the effect of hypothermia administered between 6 and 24 hours after birth on death and disability from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy ({HIE}). Hypothermia is beneficial for {HIE} when initiated within 6 hours of birth but administering hypo-thermia that soon after birth is impractical. 2 The study by Laptook et al 1 addressed the utility of inducing hypothermia 6 or more hours after birth because this is a more realistic time window given the logistics of providing this therapy. Performing this study was difficult because of the limited number of infants expected to be enrolled. To overcome this limitation, the investigators used a Bayesian analysis of the treatment effect to ensure that a clinically useful result would be obtained even if traditional approaches for defining statistical significance were impractical. The Bayesian approach allows for the integration or updating of prior information with newly obtained data to yield a final quantitative summary of the information. Laptook et al 1 considered several options for the representation of prior information-termed neutral, skeptical, and optimistic priors-generating different final summaries of the evidence. Prior Information What Is Prior Information? Prior information is the evidence or beliefs about something that exist prior to or independently of the data to be analyzed. The mathematical representation of prior information (eg, of beliefs regarding the likely efficacy of hypothermia for {HIE} 6-24 hours after birth) must summarize both the known information and the remaining uncertainty. Some prior information is quite strong, such as data from many similar patients, and might have little remaining uncertainty or it can be weak or uninformative with substantial uncertainty. Clinicians routinely interpret the results of a new study in the context of prior work. Are the new results consistent? How can new information be synthesized with the old? Often this synthesis is done by clinicians when they consider the totality of evidence used to treat patients or interpret research studies. Prior information may be formally incorporated in trial analysis using Bayes theorem, which provides a mechanism for synthesizing information from multiple sources. 3,4 Clear specification of the prior information used and assumptions made need to be reported in the article or appendix to allow transparency in the analysis and reporting of outcomes. Why Is Prior Information Important? When large quantities of patient outcome data are available, traditional non-Bayesian (frequentist) and Bayesian approaches for quantifying observed treatment effects will yield similar results because the contribution of the observed data will outweigh that of the prior information. This is not the case for evaluating {HIE} treatments because very few neonates are affected. Despite a large research network , Laptook et al 1 were only able to enroll 168 eligible newborns in 8 years. Prior information facilitates more efficient study design, allowing stronger, more definitive conclusions without requiring additional patients to be included in the study or analysis. As such, the use of prior information is particularly relevant and important for the study of rare diseases where patient resources are limited. Prior information can take a number of forms. For example, for binary outcomes, the knowledge that an adverse outcome occurs in 15\% to 40\% of cases is worth the equivalent of having to enroll 30 or more patients into the trial (depending on the certainty attached to this knowledge). Another form of prior information could be beliefs held regarding the effect of a delay beyond 6 hours in instituting therapeutic hypothermia, ie, that the treatment effect at 7 hours is similar to that at 6 hours and the longer it takes to begin treatment, the less effective the treatment is likely to be. Limitations of Prior Information Prior information is a form of assumption. As with any assumption, incorrect prior information can result in invalid or misleading conclusions. For instance, if prior information used the assumption that hypothermia becomes less effective with increasing postnatal age and, in fact, waiting until 12 to 24 hours was associated with the greatest benefit, the resulting inferences would likely be incompatible with the data, less accurate, or biased. If the statistical model uses prior information derived from neonates 0 to 6 hours old in evaluating the treatment effect in neonates 6 to 24 hours of age, and is based on the assumption that the patients respond similarly, the results may be biased or less accurate if the 2 age groups actually respond differently to treatment. These assumptions can be assessed. Just as the modeling assumptions made in logistic regression can be checked through goodness of fit tests, 5 there are tests that can be used to verify agreement between prior and current data. More importantly, some methods for incorporating prior information can explicitly adjust to conflict between the prior and the data, decreasing the reliance on prior information when the new data appear to be inconsistent with the proposed prior information. 6 How Was Prior Information Used? Laptook et al 1 incorporated prior information by allowing for the outcome to vary across time windows of 6 to 12 hours and 12 to 24 hours and prespecifying 3 separate prior distributions on the overall treatment effect (Description of Bayesian Analyses and Implementation Details section of the {eAppendix} in Supplement 2). The neutral prior assumes that the treatment effect diminishes completely after 6 hours, the enthusiastic prior assumes that effect does not},

	abstract = {Treatment effects will differ from one study to another evaluating similartherapies,bothbecauseofrandomvariationbetweenindividual patients and owing to true differences that exist because of other differences , including inclusion criteria and temporal trends. The sources of variability have many levels; onelevelinvolvestherandomdif-ferences between individual patients , and another level involves the systematic differences that exist between studies. This mul-tilevelorhierarchicalinformationoccursinmanyresearchsettings,such as in cluster-randomized trials and meta-analyses. 1,2 Sources of variation can be better understood and quantified if treatment effect estimates from each individual study are examined in relation to the totality of information available in all the studies. Bayesian analysis differs from the usual frequentist approach (eg, use of P values or confidence intervals). Rather than focusing on the probability of different patterns in outcomes assuming specific treatment effects, Bayesian analysis relies on the use of prior information in combination with data from a study to calculate the probabilities of a treatment effect. 3 Readers may be familiar with Bayesian analysis when used in randomized clinical trials. 4,5 In this type of Bayesian analysis, patients are considered largely equivalent except with respect to the assigned treatment, and the goal is to estimate the probability of an overall treatment effect in the population. In contrast, a Bayesian hierarchical model ({BHM}) is a statistical procedure that integrates information across many levels, so multiple quantities are estimated simultaneously, and explicitly separates the observed variability into parts attributable to random differences and true differences. 6 The model has 2 key characteristics. First, there is a hierarchical or multilevel structure. For example, if multiple studies were conducted to evaluate diabetes management strategies, the first-level data may be improvements in hemoglobin A 1C values in individual patients, the second-level data may be the mean improvements for patients within each trial, and the third-level data may be the average improvements in trials grouped according to the type of disease management strategy. Second, prior information is used to reflect available information, even if vague, regarding the likely values and variability at each level of the hierarchy (eg, the variability of improvements in patients in a single trial, the variability of average treatment effects between trials using similar disease management strategies, and the variability of treatment effects among groups of trials that use different disease management strategies). Using Bayes theorem, prior information, and the data, the {BHM} yields estimates of the true effects at each level of the hierarchy. 3,6 Estimates of true treatment effects may be derived for individual patients, patient subgroups, individual trials, or groups of trials. Each of these estimates are informed by the entire data set included in the statistical model. 6 In this issue of {JAMA}, Stunnenberg and colleagues present the results of a trial that used a {BHM} to integrate data from a series of N-of-1 crossover trials 7 comparing mexiletine with placebo in the treatment of patients with nondystrophic myotonia. 8 An N-of-1 trial uses a patient as his or her own control by repeatedly exposing the patient to a treatment or placebo and measuring the effect of the intervention. Each N-of-1 trial exposes the patient to between 1 and 4 treatment pairs or sets, with each set randomizing the order of mexiletine and placebo, witha1-weekwashoutperiodbetweentherapies.Aftereachtreatment set, prespecified rules were used to determine whether the patient should continue to the next treatment set or discontinue, either for evidence of benefit of mexiletine, evidence of no benefit, or for reaching the maximum allowed number of treatment sets. A {BHM} was used to {integratedatafromallavailableN}-of-1trialsperformedinallthepatients to produce estimates of treatment effects for each patient individually and also for 2 genetic subtypes of the disease. Why Is a {BHM} Used? Multilevel data have an underlying hierarchical structure. In the report by Stunnenberg et al, each trial had data from a single patient, and patients were grouped into genetic subtypes. Properly integrating this information required acknowledging the commonali-ties, eg, data from 2 patients having the same genetic subtype are more likely to be similar than data from 2 patients having different genetic subtypes. Heterogeneity between genetic subtypes and patient-to-patient variability are simultaneously accounted for in the {BHM}. A pooled analysis, ie, simply combining data from all patients , would not account for systematic patient-to-patient differences. At the other extreme, analyzing each individual patient's trial separately would not account for the information available across all the trials. This could result in underpowered analyses. By considering the results across all trials, {BHMs} allow for more ac-curateestimatesofthetreatmenteffectsforeachindividualtrialbecause of a fundamental fact about multilevel data-namely, that regardless of the true systematic differences between the true treatment effects estimated by each trial, random variability is more likely to amplify these differences than diminish them. For example, suppose 4 single-interventiongrouptrialsof100patientseachareconductedtoestimate acommonrateofaparticularpatientoutcome,whichis,hypothetically, 60\% for all of the trials. Because of random variability in 100 patients, it is likely that one of the studies will produce an observed rate less than 60\%, while another will produce an observed rate greater than 60\%. Even though the studies all have exactly equal true underlying rates, numerical simulation demonstrates that the lowest observed value will average54.9\%andthehighestwillaverage65.0\%.Eventhoughnotrue heterogeneityexists,whenactualobservationsaremadetheresultswill appear heterogeneous because of random variation.

	abstract = {Unbiasedness as conventionally understood is not a necessary property of good inferences. Such unbiasedness is "di-rect"-it guarantees that, on average, an estimate equals the thing it is estimating (the parameter). Strange as it may seem, this does not mean that the parameter is on average equal to its estimate. This would require the very different property of inverse unbiasedness. When this phenomenon is understood, shrinkage of results can be seen to be a necessary fact of life. (Epidemiology 2008;19: 652-654) J ohn Ioannidis 1 is to be congratulated on promoting an awareness of the fallibility of research findings. I agree with his conclusions that true associations are inflated (on average) but I have a somewhat different view as to why, which I shall try explain. In my opinion much of the confusion regarding the reliability of research findings is due to basic misunderstandings of statistics and in particular of the weasel-word "bias." A trivial fact of logic that applies to syllogisms and one that, by extension, applies to probabilities and other inferential statements, is that you cannot transpose conditionals. Thus it is true that a minority of women are suffering from breast cancer but it is false that a minority of breast cancer sufferers are women. Many who are perfectly aware of this logic when they are required to think about it, nevertheless completely overlook its crucial relevance to statistical inference. Consider for example a randomized clinical trial in which true diastolic blood pressure, , at baseline is measured with error so that X is the observed blood pressure. Suppose we knew that the true mean difference, , between patients (in mm Hg) was. What does this tell us about the observed difference, D, in these patients? If measurement is unbiased and independent of , so that errors are randomly above or below the true value with an expected difference of zero, then the answer is that we expect the observed difference to be so that E D . Now, however, suppose that we were to reverse the question and ask, given that the observed difference D (in mm Hg) is d, what do we expect the true difference to be? It turns out that the answer is less than d, so that E  D d d. This can easily be explained in terms of regression coefficients. The regression of observed on true is the covari-ance of true and observed, X , divided by the variance of true, 2. Under the model, these 2 values are the same and so X 2. Hence the regression is 1.0. On the other hand if we regress true on observed we take the same covariance but divide by the variance of observed, X 2 , which, due to measurement error, is greater than the variance of true; thus X 2 2 and therefore X 2 X. Hence we have a regression to the mean. I note, by the by, that failure to understand this distinction has led to incorrect claims that, when covariates are measured with error, analysis of covariance in randomized clinical trials is biased due to attenuation of the regression effect between outcome and covariate. However, this overlooks the other regression (of true baseline difference on observed baseline difference), and it turns out that the two cancel. 2 Now consider a large collection of true treatment effects ; it may be helpful to consider the context of a microar-ray as an example. These effects are measured with perfectly unbiased "studies," which are, of necessity, of limited precision. The variance of the estimates will exceed the variance of the true effects. It thus follows that even if all the experiments are perfectly unbiased-so that, on average, conditional on a given true treatment effect the observed effect, is equal to the effect it is estimating-the reverse does not hold. We can expect that any true effect will be closer to the mean of all effects than is the observed effect. Note that this applies even if all the scientists involved are experimental saints who measure everything in a perfectly un-biased way. The point is that unbiasedness is a property that applies to the "forward expectation" of observed effects given true effects, but not therefore to the "backward expectation" of true effects given observed effects. To assume that the one implies the other is to make a comparable error of logic to assuming that because Greeks are with 100\% probability Euro-pean, Europeans are with 100\% probability Greek.},

The latter is a special mixture of two betas, which greatly extends the shapes of the beta distribution mainly in terms of asymmetry, bimodality and heavy tail behaviour. Its special mixture structure ensures good theoretical properties, such as strong identifiability and likelihood boundedness, quite uncommon for mixture models. Moreover, it makes the model computationally very tractable also within the Bayesian framework here adopted. At the same time, the {FB} regression model displays easiness of interpretation as well as remarkable fitting capacity for a variety of data patterns, including uni-modal and bimodal ones, heavy tails and presence of outliers. Indeed, simulation studies and applications to real datasets show a general better performance of the {FB} regression model with respect to competing ones, namely the beta (Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004) and the beta rectangular (Bayes et al., 2012), in terms of precision of estimates, goodness of fit and posterior predictive intervals.},

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the spar-sity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances. {MSC} 2010 subject classifications: Primary 62F15.},

	abstract = {Accurate mechanistic description of structural changes in biomolecules is an increasingly important topic in structural and chemical biology. Markov models have emerged as a powerful way to approximate the molecular kinetics of large biomolecules while keeping full structural resolution in a divide-and-conquer fashion. However, the accuracy of these models is limited by that of the force fields used to generate the underlying molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation data. Whereas the quality of classical {MD} force fields has improved significantly in recent years, remaining errors in the Boltzmann weights are still on the order of a few [Formula: see text], which may lead to significant discrepancies when comparing to experimentally measured rates or state populations. Here we take the view that simulations using a sufficiently good force-field sample conformations that are valid but have inaccurate weights, yet these weights may be made accurate by incorporating experimental data a posteriori. To do so, we propose augmented Markov models ({AMMs}), an approach that combines concepts from probability theory and information theory to consistently treat systematic force-field error and statistical errors in simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that {AMMs} can reconcile conflicting results for protein mechanisms obtained by different force fields and correct for a wide range of stationary and dynamical observables even when only equilibrium measurements are incorporated into the estimation process. This approach constitutes a unique avenue to combine experiment and computation into integrative models of biomolecular structure and dynamics.},

A follow-up paper with various extensions is Grün, Kosmidis, and Zeileis (2012)-a slightly modified version of which is also provided within the package as vignette("betareg-ext", package = "betareg") The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (poten-tially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

In {BVS}, if the statistical p value of a risk factor in bivariable analysis is greater than an arbitrary value (often p = 0.05), then this factor will not be allowed to compete for inclusion in multivariable analysis. This type of variable selection is inappropriate because the {BVS} method wrongly rejects potentially important variables when the relationship between an outcome and a risk factor is confounded by any confounder and when this confounder is not properly controlled. This article uses both hypothetical and actual data to show how a nonsignificant risk factor in bivariable analysis may actually be a significant risk factor in multivariable analysis if confounding is properly controlled. Furthermore, problems resulting from the automated forward and stepwise modeling with or without the presence of confounding are also addressed. To avoid these improper procedures and deficiencies, alternatives in performing multivariable analysis, including advantages and disadvantages of the {BVS} method and automated stepwise modeling, are reviewed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Loss to follow-up is often hard to avoid in randomised trials. This article suggests a framework for intention to treat analysis that depends on making plausible assumptions about the missing data and including all participants in sensitivity analyses The intention to treat principle requires all participants in a clinical trial to be included in the analysis in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of any departures from randomised treatment.1 This principle is a key defence against bias, since participants who depart from randomised treatment are usually a non-random subset whose exclusion can lead to serious selection bias.2 However, it is unclear how to apply the intention to treat principle when investigators are unable to follow up all randomised participants. Filling in (imputing) the missing values is often seen as the only alternative to omitting participants from the analysis.3 In particular, imputing by “last observation carried forward” is widely used,4 but this approach has serious drawbacks.3 For example, last observation carried forward was applied in a recent trial of a novel drug treatment in Alzheimer's disease.5 The analysis was criticised because it effectively assumed that loss to follow-up halts disease progression,6 but the authors argued that their analysis was in fact conservative.7 Increasingly, trialists are expected to justify their handling of missing data and not simply rely on techniques that have been used in other clinical contexts.8 To guide investigators dealing with these tricky issues, we propose a four point framework for dealing with incomplete observations (box). Our aim is not to describe specific methods for analysing missing data, since these are described elsewhere,9 10 but to provide the framework within which methods can be chosen and implemented.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01755},
	abstract = {The Rashomon effect occurs when many different explanations exist for the same phenomenon. In machine learning, Leo Breiman used this term to describe problems where many accurate-but-different models exist to describe the same data. In this work, we study how the Rashomon effect can be useful for understanding the relationship between training and test performance, and the possibility that simple-yet-accurate models exist for many problems. We introduce the Rashomon set as the set of almost-equally-accurate models for a given problem, and study its properties and the types of models it could contain. We present the Rashomon ratio as a new measure related to simplicity of model classes, which is the ratio of the volume of the set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space; the Rashomon ratio is different from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory. For a hierarchy of hypothesis spaces, the Rashomon ratio can help modelers to navigate the trade-off between simplicity and accuracy in a surprising way. In particular, we find empirically that a plot of empirical risk vs. Rashomon ratio forms a characteristic \${\textbackslash}{backslashGamma}\$-shaped Rashomon curve, whose elbow seems to be a reliable model selection criterion. When the Rashomon set is large, models that are accurate - but that also have various other useful properties - can often be obtained. These models might obey various constraints such as interpretability, fairness, monotonicity, and computational benefits.},

	abstract = {The distinction between explanation and prediction has received much attention in recent literature, but the equally important distinction between explanation and description (or between prediction and description) remains blurred. This latter distinction is particularly important in the social sciences, where probabilistic models (or theories) often play dual roles as explanatory and descriptive devices. The distinction between explanation (or prediction) and description is explicated in the present paper in terms of information theory. The explanatory (or predictive) power of a probabilistic model is identified with information taken from (or transmitted by) the environment (e.g., the independent, experimentally manipulated variables), while the descriptive power of a model reflects additional information taken from (or transmitted by) the data. Although information is usually transmitted by the data in the process of estimating parameters, it turns out that the number of free parameters is not a reliable index of transmitted information. Thus, the common practice of treating parameters as 'degrees-of-freedom' in testing probabilistic models is questionable. Finally, this information-theoretic analysis of explanation, prediction, and description suggests ways of resolving some recent controversies surrounding the pragmatic aspects of explanation and the so-called structural identity thesis. © 1969 D.

	abstract = {Anyone, today, with even a slight interest in the methodology of science will be aware of the heated debate which has raged in regard to the thesis of the logical symmetry between explanation and prediction, which is entailed by the hypothetico-deductive account of scientific theory. The symmetry thesis, which received its classical exposition in a well-known article by Hempel and Oppenheim [2], has been subject to a steadily growing criticism by several eminent thinkers. My intention, in this article, is to argue that the current reaction to the Hempel-Oppenheim position, as exemplified by Professors Hanson, Scriven, et al., represents a retrograde movement in the philosophy of science, which, as the number of its converts grows, could undermine the progress, which has been accomplished in the broad tradition that extends from Mach and Poincare through the Vienna Circle to the present day. Specifically, it is my contention that the aforementioned reaction is symptomatic of a contemporary trend in the direction of irrationalism which, of all branches of philosophy , the philosophy of science should seek to dispel rather than to foster. For the sake of brevity, I propose to focus my remarks wholly on the original widely read article of Hanson on this subject [1]. That I single out this particular source should not be taken to belie the admiration I hold for the masterful scholarship of its author. Hanson argues that the symmetry thesis, while feasible, is an ideal to which science rarely approximates in practice: "In fact, the history of science presents very few examples of disciplines wherein this optimum state of affairs has actually been achieved. Aristotle's cosmology, for example, while it certainly did explain the perturbations of the celestial bodies, could not begin to predict where any planet might appear on any particular day. Nevertlheless, his 'word-pictures' undoubtedly made the cosmos seem more intelligible to his contemporaries , and in some sense of 'explanation' this counts as an explanation. To deny this would be merely to legislate on how 'explanation' ought to be used for certain logical or philosophical purposes. It is to leave undiscussed those accounts which actually have counted in the past, anid actually count now, as the offering of explanations ." ([1], p. 350) Conversely, he points out that certain of the great astronomers of antiquity, such as Eudoxus and Ptolemy, were eminently successful in predicting planetary positions even though they explicitly denied the very possibility of explaining planetary motion. Such considerations lead Hanson to formulate a sweeping historical generalization: "Indeed, the subsequent history of planetary theory could be written as consisting in a conceptual struggle between these two opposed attractive forces, the urge to explain and the urge to predict."

What are the criteria for a good explanation? Is it possible to satisfy all the desiderata simultaneously? If not, which should we regard as paramount? What is the connection between explanation and prediction? What exactly is it that statistical explanations explain?

In attempting to answer them, definite views will have to be taken on related matters, such as physical laws, causality, reduction, and questions of evidence and confirmation, of theory and observation, realism versus antirealism, and the objectivity and rationality of science. I will state my own views on these matters, in the course of this essay. To argue for everything in detail and to do justice to all the alternative views, would fill a book, perhaps several books.

	abstract = {Social media are nowadays one of the main news sources for millions of people around the globe due to their low cost, easy access and rapid dissemination. This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers. Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social context or 'common sense', which current {NLP} algorithms are still missing. Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical {CNNs} to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly accurate (92.7\% {ROC} {AUC}) fake news detection. Second, we observe that fake news can be reliably detected at an early stage, after just a few hours of propagation. Third, we test the aging of our model on training and testing data separated in time. Our results point to the promise of propagation-based approaches for fake news detection as an alternative or complementary strategy to content-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of "fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineffective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

Fake reviews have affected consumers and stores alike. Furthermore, the problem of fake news has gained attention in 2016, especially in the aftermath of the last U.S. presidential elections. Fake reviews and fake news are a closely related phenomenon as both consist of writing and spreading false information or beliefs. The opinion spam problem was formulated for the first time a few years ago, but it has quickly become a growing research area due to the abundance of user‐generated content. It is now easy for anyone to either write fake reviews or write fake news on the web. The biggest challenge is the lack of an efficient way to tell the difference between a real review and a fake one; even humans are often unable to tell the difference. In this paper, we introduce a new n‐gram model to detect automatically fake contents with a particular focus on fake reviews and fake news. We study and compare 2 different features extraction techniques and 6 machine learning classification techniques. Experimental evaluation using existing public datasets and a newly introduced fake news dataset indicate very encouraging and improved performances compared to the state‐of‐the‐art methods.},

	abstract = {The digital information age has generated new outlets for content creators to publish so-called "fake news", a new form of propaganda that is intentionally designed to mislead the reader. With the widespread effects of the fast dissemination of fake news, efforts have been made to automate the process of fake news detection. A promising solution that has come up recently is to use machine learning to detect patterns in the news sources and articles, specifically deep neural networks, which have been successful in natural language processing. However, deep networks come with lack of transparency in the decision-making process, i.e. the "black-box problem", which obscures its reliability. In this paper, we open this "black-box" and we show that the emergent representations from deep neural networks capture subtle but consistent differences in the language of fake and real news: signatures of exaggeration and other forms of rhetoric. Unlike previous work, we test the transferability of the learning process to novel news topics. Our results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of deep learning to detect fake news in novel subjects only from language patterns. 1},

Little systematic, data-based evidence has been published to guide these efforts. Here we analyze 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand articles on Twitter during ten months in 2016 and 2017. We find evidence that social bots played a disproportionate role in spreading articles from low-credibility sources. Bots amplify such content in the early spreading moments, before an article goes viral. They also target users with many followers through replies and mentions. Humans are vulnerable to this manipulation, resharing content posted by bots. Successful low-credibility sources are heavily supported by social bots. These results suggest that curbing social bots may be an effective strategy for mitigating the spread of online misinformation.},

	abstract = {We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ∼126,000 stories tweeted by ∼3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

	abstract = {Recently, there have been many research efforts aiming to understand fake news phenomena and to identify typical patterns and features of fake news. Yet, the real discriminating power of these features is still unknown: some are more general, but others perform well only with specific data. In this work, we conduct a highly exploratory investigation that produced hundreds of thousands of models from a large and diverse set of features. These models are unbiased in the sense that their features are randomly chosen from the pool of available features. While the vast majority of models are ineffective, we were able to produce a number of models that yield highly accurate decisions, thus effectively separating fake news from actual stories. Specifically, we focused our analysis on models that rank a randomly chosen fake news story higher than a randomly chosen fact with more than 0.85 probability. For these models we found a strong link between features and model predictions, showing that some features are clearly tailored for detecting certain types of fake news, thus evidencing that different combinations of features cover a specific region of the fake news space. Finally, we present an explanation of factors contributing to model decisions, thus promoting civic reasoning by complementing our ability to evaluate digital content and reach warranted conclusions.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},
