	abstract = {Alsin is a protein of 1,657 amino acids known for its crucial role in vesicular trafficking in neurons thanks to its ability to interact with two guanosine triphosphatases, Rac1 and Rab5. Evidence suggests that Rac1 can bind Alsin central region, composed by a Dbl Homology ({DH}) domain followed by a Pleckstrin Homology ({PH}) domain, leading to Alsin relocalization. However, Alsin three-dimensional structure and its relationship with known biological functions of this protein are still unknown. In this work, a homology model of the Alsin {DH}/{PH} domain was developed and studied through molecular dynamics both in the presence and in the absence of its binding partner, Rac1. Due to different conformations of {DH} domain, the presence of Rac1 seems to stabilize an open state of the protein, while the absence of its binding partner results in closed conformations. Furthermore, Rac1 interaction was able to reduce the fluctuations in the second conserved region of {DH} motif, which may be involved in the formation of a homodimer. Moreover, the dynamics of {DH}/{PH} was described through a Markov State Model to study the pathways linking the open and closed states. In conclusion, this work provided an all-atom model for the {DH}/{PH} domain of Alsin protein; moreover, molecular dynamics investigations suggested underlying molecular mechanisms in the signal transduction between Rac1 and Alsin, providing the basis for a deeper understanding of the whole structure–function relationship for Alsin protein.},

            Partner recognition in protein binding is critical for all biological functions, and yet, delineating its mechanism is challenging, especially when recognition happens within microseconds. We present a theoretical and experimental framework based on straight-forward nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion measurements to investigate protein binding mechanisms on sub-millisecond timescales, which are beyond the reach of standard rapid-mixing experiments. This framework predicts that conformational selection prevails on ubiquitin’s paradigmatic interaction with an {SH}3 (Src-homology 3) domain. By contrast, the {SH}3 domain recognizes ubiquitin in a two-state binding process. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state modeling reveal that the ubiquitin conformation selected for binding exhibits a characteristically extended C-terminus. Our framework is robust and expandable for implementation in other binding scenarios with the potential to show that conformational selection might be the design principle of the hubs in protein interaction networks.},

	abstract = {{RNA} dependent {RNA} polymerase ({RdRP}) from positive-stranded {RNA} viruses has always been a hot target for designing of new drugs. Major class of drugs that are targeted against {RdRP} are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides ({NTPs}) and its analogues leading to significant structural variation in the {RdRP} has been presented here. {RdRP} simulations in its apo, {NTP}-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the {RdRP} molecule has been explored using principal component ({PCA}) and Markov state modeling ({MSM}) analysis. {PCA} inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of {RdRP}. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent {RNA} template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. {MSM} analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the {RdRP}. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

Here, we perform molecular dynamic simulations to explore Na+ binding in the cannabinoid receptors, {CB}1 and {CB}2. Simulations reveal that Na+ binds to the primary binding site from different extracellular sites for {CB}1 and {CB}2. A distinct secondary Na+ coordination site is identified in {CB}1 that is not present in {CB}2. Furthermore, simulations also show that intracellular Na+ could bind to the Na+ binding site in {CB}1.

	abstract = {This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of {CLC}-2 “fast” (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulation. In the starting conformation of our {CLC}-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-{EM} structure of the bovine {CLC}-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue {GLUex}. Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient {GLUex} away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of {GLUex} results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low (∼1\%), consistent with the low open probability of {CLC}-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 {mV}). In the second additional state, {GLUex} rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population (∼1\%), is only accessible when {GLUex} is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the {CLC}-2 selectivity filter, as a function of {GLUex} protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of {CLC}-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.},

This is due to the several unique features in the {AsLOV}2, such as the monomeric structure of the protein in both light and dark states and the relatively short transition time between the two states. Despite that, not many studies focus on the effect of the secondary structures on the drastic conformational change between the light and dark states. In this study, we focus on the role of A’α helix as a key player in the transition between both states using various computational tools as: 1.5 μs molecular dynamics simulations for each configuration, Markov state model, different machine learning techniques, and community analysis. The impact of the A’α helix was studied on the atomistic level by introducing two groups of mutations, helicity enhancing mutations (T406A and T407A) and helicity disrupting mutations (L408D and R410P), as well as on the overall secondary structure by using the community analysis. Maintaining the N-terminal hydrogen bond network was found to be essential for the transition between the two states. Via in-depth hydrogen bonding and contact analysis we were able to identify key residues (Thr407 and Arg410) involved in the functional conformational switch and their impact on the overall protein dynamics. Moreover, the community analysis highlighted the significant role of the β sheets in the overall protein allosteric process.},

To understand the allosteric communication within the {GR} ligand binding domain, the folding pathway of helix 12 (H12) induced by the binding of the agonist dexamethasone ({DEX}), antagonist {RU}486, and modulator {AZD}9567 are explored by molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state model analysis. The ligands can regulate the volume of the activation function-2 through the residues Phe737 and Gln738. Without ligand or with agonist binding, H12 swings from inward to outward to visit different folding positions. However, the binding of {RU}486 or {AZD}9567 perturbs the structural state, and the passive antagonist state appears more stable. Structure-based virtual screening and in vitro bioassays are used to discover novel {GR} ligands that bias the conformation equilibria toward the passive antagonist state. {HP}-19 exhibits the best anti-inflammatory activity ({IC}50 = 0.041 ± 0.011 µm) in nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway, which is comparable to that of {DEX}. {HP}-19 also does not induce adverse effect-related transactivation functions of {GR}.

The antigen-binding site is formed by six hypervariable loops, known as the complementarity determining regions ({CDRs}) and by the relative interdomain orientation ({VH}–{VL}). Antibody {CDR} loops with a certain sequence have been thought to be limited to a single static canonical conformation determining their binding properties. However, it has been shown that antibodies exist as ensembles of multiple paratope states, which are defined by a characteristic combination of {CDR} loop conformations and interdomain orientations. In this study, we thermodynamically and kinetically characterize the prominent role of residue 71H (Chothia nomenclature), which does not only codetermine the canonical conformation of the {CDR}-H2 loop but also results in changes in conformational diversity and population shifts of the {CDR}-H1 and {CDR}-H3 loop. As all {CDR} loop movements are correlated, conformational rearrangements of the heavy chain {CDR} loops also induce conformational changes in the {CDR}-L1, {CDR}-L2, and {CDR}-L3 loop. These overall conformational changes of the {CDR} loops also influence the interface angle distributions, consequentially leading to different paratope states in solution. Thus, the type of residue of 71H, either an alanine or an arginine, not only influences the {CDR}-H2 loop ensembles, but co-determines the paratope states in solution. Characterization of the functional consequences of mutations of residue 71H on the paratope states and interface orientations has broad implications in the field of antibody engineering.},

The oncoprotein Ras is also found to be mutated in {\textasciitilde}90\% of the pancreatic cancers, of which G12V, G13V, A59G and Q61L are the known hot-spot mutants. These ubiquitous proteins fall in the family of G-proteins, and hence switches between active {GTP} bound and inactive {GDP} bound states, which is hindered in most of its oncogenic mutant counterparts. Moreover, Ras being a {GTPase} has an intrinsic property to hydrolyze {GTP} to {GDP}, which is obstructed due to mutations and lends the mutants stuck in constitutively active state leading to oncogenic behavior. In this regard, the present study aims to understand the dynamics involved in the hot-spot mutant A59G-Ras using long 10μs classical {MD} simulations (5μs for each of the wild-type and mutant systems) and comparing the same with its wild-type counterpart. Advanced analytics using Markov State Model ({MSM}) based approach has been deployed to comparatively understand the transition path for the wild-type and mutant systems. Roles of crucial residues like Tyr32, Gln61 and Tyr64 have also been established using multivariate {PCA} analyses. Furthermore, this multivariate {PCA} analysis also provides crucial features which may be used as reaction coordinates for biased simulations for further studies. The absence of formation of pre-hydrolysis network is also reported for the mutant conformation, using the distance-based analyses (between crucial residues) of the conserved regions. The implications of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the disruption of the pre-hydrolysis network in the mutant A59G ensemble might lead to permanently active oncogenic conformation in the mutant conformers.},

Once displaced from the crystallographic binding pose, imatinib becomes trapped in intermediate states. These intermediates are characterized by a high diversity of ligand orientations and conformations, and relaxation timescales within this region may exceed 3–4 ms. Analysis indicates that the metastable intermediate states should be spectroscopically indistinguishable from the crystallographic binding pose, in agreement with tryptophan stopped-flow fluorescence experiments.},

	abstract = {Aβ42 peptides can form helix and sheet structure under different conditions. The conformational conversion is closely associated with Aβ peptides aggregation and their neurotoxicity. But the transition from helix to sheet is not be clearly understood. In this study we performed microsecond timescale {MD} simulations of Aβ42 peptide to investigate the conformation transition from α-helix to β-sheet. Markov state model ({MSM}) was built to facilitate identification of crucial intermediate states and possible transition pathway. Based on the analysis, we found that the region Y10-A21 in the middle of Aβ42 peptide plays an initial role in this transition. {MSM} model revealed that the collapse of helical structure in this region might trigger the formation of sheet structure. Moreover, we further simulated the aggregation of Aβ42 peptides with different conformations. We found that the Aβ42 peptides forming sheet structure have higher aggregation potential compared with peptides with helix structure. These results demonstrate that we can prevent the aggregation of Aβ42 peptides by stabilizing the helix structure in the region of Y10-A21. In addition, this study provides new insight into better understanding the conformational transition and aggregation of Aβ42 peptides.},

The mechanism of signaling transduction in the {PtAu}1a {LOV} domain ({AuLOV}) including flanking helices remains unclear because of this dissimilarity, which hinders the study of {PtAu}1a as an optogenetic tool. To clarify this mechanism, we employed a combination of tree-based machine learning models, Markov state models, machine-learning-based community analysis, and transition path theory to quantitatively analyze the allosteric process. Our results are in good agreement with the reported experimental findings and reveal a previously overlooked Cα helix and protein linkers as important in promoting the protein conformational changes. This integrated approach can be considered as a general workflow and applied on other allosteric proteins to provide detailed information about their allosteric mechanisms.},

This perspective offers an overview of the {MSM} field to date, presented for a general audience as a timeline of key developments in the field. We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of {MSMs} for {MD} analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols. The derivation of a variational principle for {MSMs} in 2013 signified a turning point from expertise-driving {MSM} building to a systematic, objective protocol. The variational approach, combined with best practices for model selection and open-source software, enabled a wide range of {MSM} analysis for applications such as protein folding and allostery, ligand binding, and protein–protein association. To conclude, the current frontiers of methods development are highlighted, as well as exciting applications in experimental design and drug discovery.},

In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, {MSMs} greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments. A variety of methodological advances and software packages now bring the construction of these models closer to routine practice.

	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimiza-tion. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a compar-ison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural net-works and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising con-figuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent " High Throughput " methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural base-line against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method’s full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned. In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task ({LFW}), a face identification task ({PubFig}83) and an object recognition task ({CIFAR}-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 μs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.

  abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful framework for the analysis of molecular dynamics data sets, such as protein folding simulations, because of their straightforward construction and statistical rigor. The coarsegraining of MSMs into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here we present the minimum variance clustering approach (MVCA) for the coarse-graining of MSMs into macrostate models. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward's minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics is determined using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the MSM transition probability matrix. We first show that MVCA produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system and is robust toward long-duration statistical artifacts. MVCA is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in different force fields to demonstrate that a different number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a data set containing many MSMs from simulations in different force fields by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force field parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen-Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.},

A promising approach to enhanced sampling of MSMs is to use ``adaptive'' methods, in which new MD trajectories are ``seeded'' preferentially from previously identified states. Here, we investigate the performance of various MSM estimators applied to reseeding trajectory data, for both a simple 1D free energy landscape and mini-protein folding MSMs of WW domain and NTL9(1\textendash 39). Our results reveal the practical challenges of reseeding simulations and suggest a simple way to reweight seeding trajectory data to better estimate both thermodynamic and kinetic quantities.},

In molecular dynamics simulations, these data-driven collective variables capture the slowest modes of the dynamics and are useful for enhanced sampling and free energy estimation. In this work, we employ SRV coordinates as a feature set for Markov state model (MSM) construction. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, MSMs constructed from SRV coordinates are more robust to the choice of input features, exhibit faster implied time scale convergence, and permit the use of shorter lagtimes to construct higher kinetic resolution models. We apply this methodology to study the folding kinetics and conformational landscape of the Trp-cage miniprotein. Folding and unfolding mean first passage times are in good agreement with the prior literature, and a nine macrostate model is presented. The unfolded ensemble comprises a central kinetic hub with interconversions to several metastable unfolded conformations and which serves as the gateway to the folded ensemble. The folded ensemble comprises the native state, a partially unfolded intermediate ``loop'' state, and a previously unreported short-lived intermediate that we were able to resolve due to the high time resolution of the SRV-MSM. We propose SRVs as an excellent candidate for integration into modern MSM construction pipelines.},

  abstract = {Spectroscopic techniques such as Trp\textendash Tyr quenching, luminescence resonance energy transfer, and triplet\textendash triplet energy transfer are widely used for understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins. These experiments measure the relaxation of a particular labeled set of residue pairs, and the choice of residue pairs requires careful thought. As a result, experimentalists must pick residue pairs from a large pool of possibilities. In the current work, we show that molecular simulation datasets of protein dynamics can be used to systematically select an optimal set of residue positions to place probes for conducting spectroscopic experiments. The method described in this work, called Optimal Probes, can be used to rank trial sets of residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Optimal probes ensures two conditions: residue pairs capture the slow dynamics of the protein and their dynamics is not correlated for maximum information gain to score each trial set. Eventually, the highest scored set can be used for biophysical experiments to study the kinetics of the protein. The scoring methodology is based on kinetic network models of protein dynamics and a variational principle for molecular kinetics to optimize the hyperparameters used for the model. We also discuss that the scoring strategy used by Optimal Probes is the best possible way to ensure the ideal choice of residue pairs for experiments. We predict the best experimental probe positions for proteins {$\lambda$}-repressor, {$\beta$}2-adrenergic receptor, and villin headpiece domain. These proteins have been well-studied and allow for a rigorous comparison of Optimal Probes predictions with already available experiments. Additionally, we also illustrate that our method can be used to predict the best choice for experiments by including any previous experiment choices available from other studies on the same protein. We consistently find that the best choice cannot be based on intuition or structural information such as distance difference between few known stable structures of the protein. Therefore, we show that incorporating protein dynamics could be used to maximize the information gain from experiments.}

  abstract = {Beta-hairpins are substructures found in proteins that can lend insight into more complex systems. Furthermore, the folding of beta-hairpins is a valuable test case for benchmarking experimental and theoretical methods. Here, we simulate the folding of CLN025, a miniprotein with a beta-hairpin structure, at its experimental melting temperature using a range of state-of-the-art protein force fields. We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AMBER-FB15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental CLN025 conformational ensemble, while the AMBER ff99SB-ILDN and CHARMM22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.},

  abstract = {Adaptive sampling methods, often used in combination with Markov state models, are becoming increasingly popular for speeding up rare events in simulation such as molecular dynamics (MD) without biasing the system dynamics. Several adaptive sampling strategies have been proposed, but it is not clear which methods perform better for different physical systems. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of selected adaptive sampling strategies on a wide selection of fast folding proteins. The adaptive sampling strategies were emulated using models constructed on already existing MD trajectories. We provide theoretical limits for the sampling speed-up and compare the performance of different strategies with and without using some a priori knowledge of the system. The results show that for different goals, different adaptive sampling strategies are optimal. In order to sample slow dynamical processes such as protein folding without a priori knowledge of the system, a strategy based on the identification of a set of metastable regions is consistently the most efficient, while a strategy based on the identification of microstates performs better if the goal is to explore newer regions of the conformational space. Interestingly, the maximum speed-up achievable for the adaptive sampling of slow processes increases for proteins with longer folding times, encouraging the application of these methods for the characterization of slower processes, beyond the fast-folding proteins considered here.},

This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework.

Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged VAE, or variational dynamics encoder (VDE), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the VDE is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the VDE model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the VDE model to describe dynamics. The VDE presents an important step in applying techniques from deep learning to more accurately model and interpret complex biophysics.},

Previous biophysical studies have suggested that conformational exchange between a `major' active and a `minor' inactive state on millisecond timescales plays a key role in catalysis for CypA. Here this hypothesis is addressed by a variety of molecular dynamics simulation techniques. Strikingly we show that exchange between major and minor active site conformations occurs at a rate that is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed. The minor active site conformation is found to be catalytically impaired, and decreased catalytic activity of the mutants is caused by changes in Phe113 motions on a ns-{$\mu$}s timescale. Therefore millisecond timescale motions may not be necessary to explain allosteric effects in cyclophilins.},

  abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have been widely applied to study the kinetics and pathways of protein conformational dynamics based on statistical analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These MSMs coarse-grain both configuration space and time in ways that limit what kinds of observables they can reproduce with high fidelity over different spatial and temporal resolutions. Despite their popularity, there is still limited understanding of which biophysical observables can be computed from these MSMs in a robust and unbiased manner, and which suffer from the space-time coarse-graining intrinsic in the MSM model. Most theoretical arguments and practical validity tests for MSMs rely on long-time equilibrium kinetics, such as the slowest relaxation time scales and experimentally observable time-correlation functions. Here, we perform an extensive assessment of the ability of well-validated protein folding MSMs to accurately reproduce path-based observable such as mean first-passage times (MFPTs) and transition path mechanisms compared to a direct trajectory analysis. We also assess a recently proposed class of history-augmented MSMs (haMSMs) that exploit additional information not accounted for in standard MSMs. We conclude with some practical guidance on the use of MSMs to study various problems in conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In brief, MSMs can accurately reproduce correlation functions slower than the lag time, but path-based observables can only be reliably reproduced if the lifetimes of states exceed the lag time, which is a much stricter requirement. Even in the presence of short-lived states, we find that haMSMs reproduce path-based observables more reliably.},
